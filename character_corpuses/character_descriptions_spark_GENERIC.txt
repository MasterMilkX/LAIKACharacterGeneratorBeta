In #X_2#leberry Finn, #X_0# serves as a foil to #X_2#: imaginative, dominating, and given to wild plans taken from the plots of adventure novels, #X_0# is everything that #X_2# is not. #X_0#’s stubborn reliance on the “authorities” of romance novels leads him to acts of incredible stupidity and startling cruelty. His rigid adherence to society’s conventions aligns #X_0# with the “sivilizing” forces that #X_2# learns to see through and gradually abandons.

-- #X_0# --
One of Miss #X_4#’s household slaves. #X_0# is superstitious and occasionally sentimental, but he is also intelligent, practical, and ultimately more of an adult than anyone else in the novel. #X_0#’s frequent acts of selflessness, his longing for his family, and his friendship with both #X_2# and #X_3# demonstrate to #X_2# that humanity has nothing to do with race. Because #X_0# is a black man and a runaway slave, he is at the mercy of almost all the other characters in the novel and is often forced into ridiculous and degrading situations.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father, the town drunk and ne’er-do-well. #X_0# is a wreck when he appears at the beginning of the novel, with disgusting, ghostlike white skin and tattered clothes.

-- #X_0# --
A pair of con men whom #X_2# and #X_3# rescue as they are being run out of a river town. #X_0# older man, who appears to be about seventy, claims to be the “#X_0#,” the son of King #X_4# and heir to the French throne. #X_0# younger man, who is about thirty, claims to be the usurped Duke of #X_1#. Although #X_2# quickly realizes the men are frauds, he and #X_3# remain at their mercy, as #X_2# is only a child and #X_3# is a runaway slave. #X_0# carry out a number of increasingly disturbing swindles as they travel down the river on the raft.

-- #X_0# --
Two wealthy sisters who live together in a large house in #Y_0# and who adopt #X_2#. The gaunt and severe #X_0# #X_0# is the most prominent representative of the hypocritical religious and ethical values #X_3# criticizes in the novel. The #X_0# #X_0# is somewhat gentler in her beliefs and has more patience with the mischievous #X_2#. When #X_2# acts in a manner contrary to societal expectations, it is the #X_0# #X_0# whom he fears disappointing.

-- #X_0# --
The local judge who shares responsibility for #X_5# with the Widow #X_4# and is in charge of safeguarding the money that #X_5# and #X_7# found at the end of #X_7# Sawyer. When #X_5# discovers that #X_6# has returned to town, he wisely signs his fortune over to the #X_0#, who doesn’t really accept the money, but tries to comfort #X_5#. #X_0# has a daughter, #X_2#, who was #X_7#’s girlfriend in #X_7# Sawyer and whom #X_5# calls “#X_3#” in this novel.

-- #X_0# --
A family that takes #X_1# in after a steamboat hits his raft, separating him from #X_2#. #X_0# kindhearted #X_0#, who offer #X_1# a place to stay in their tacky country home, are locked in a long-standing feud with another local family, the #X_3#. #X_4# uses the two families to engage in some rollicking humor and to mock a overly romanticizes ideas about family honor. Ultimately, the families’ sensationalized feud gets many of them killed.

-- #X_0# --
At one point during their travels, the duke and the dauphin encounter a man who tells them of the death of a local named Peter #X_0#, who has left behind a rich estate. #X_0# man inadvertently gives the con men enough information to allow them to pretend to be #X_0#’s two brothers from #Y_0#, who are the recipients of much of the inheritance. #X_0# duke and the dauphin’s subsequent conning of the good-hearted and vulnerable #X_0# sisters is the first step in the con men’s increasingly cruel series of scams, which culminate in the sale of #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_7# Sawyer’s aunt and uncle, whom #X_2# coincidentally encounters in his search for #X_3# after the con men have sold him. #X_0# is the sister of #X_7#’s aunt, #X_5#. Essentially good people, the #X_0#es nevertheless hold #X_3# in custody and try to return him to his rightful owner. #X_0# and #X_0# are the unknowing victims of many of #X_7# and #X_2#’s “preparations” as they try to free #X_3#. The #X_0#es are the only intact and functional family in this novel, yet they are too much for #X_2#, who longs to escape their “sivilizing” influence.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4# Sawyer’s aunt and guardian and #X_2# sister. #X_0# appears at the end of the novel and properly identifies #X_1#, who has pretended to be #X_4#, and #X_4#, who has pretended to be his own younger brother, #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s protagonist. #X_0# is a mischievous boy with an active imagination who spends most of the novel getting himself, and often his friends, into and out of trouble. Despite his mischief, #X_0# has a good heart and a strong moral conscience. As the novel progresses, he begins to take more seriously the responsibilities of his role as a leader among his schoolfellows.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s aunt and guardian. #X_0# is a simple, kindhearted woman who struggles to balance her  love for her nephew with her duty to discipline him. She generally fails in her attempts to keep #X_1#  under control because, although she worries about #X_1#’s safety, she seems to fear constraining him too much. Above all, #X_0# wants to be appreciated and loved.

-- #X_0# --
The son of the town drunk. #X_2# is a juvenile outcast who is shunned by respectable society and adored by the local boys, who envy his freedom. Like #X_4#, #X_2# is highly superstitious, and both boys are always ready for an adventure. #X_2# gradually replaces #X_4#’s friend #X_3# as #X_4#’s sidekick in his escapades.

-- #X_0# --
Judge #X_0#’s pretty, yellow-haired daughter. From almost the minute she moves to town, #X_0# is the “Adored Unknown” who stirs #X_1#’s lively romantic sensibility. Naïve at first, #X_0# soon matches #X_1# as a romantic strategist, and the two go to great lengths to make each other jealous.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s “bosom friend” and frequent playmate. #X_0# is a typical best friend, a convention #X_4# parodies when he refers to #X_0# and #X_3# as “two souls with but a single thought.” Though #X_0# mostly mirrors #X_3#, he diverges from #X_3#’s example when he is the first of the boys to succumb to homesickness on #X_2#’s Island. As the novel progresses, #X_1# begins to assume #X_0#’s place as #X_3#’s companion.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s half-brother. #X_0# is a goody-goody who enjoys getting #X_1# into trouble. He is mean-spirited but presents a superficial show of model behavior. He is thus the opposite of #X_1#, who is warmhearted but behaves badly.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s sweet, almost saintly cousin. #X_0# holds a soft spot for #X_2#. Like #X_1#, she is well behaved, but unlike him, she acts out of genuine affection rather than malice.

-- #X_0# --
A violent, villainous man who commits murder, becomes a robber, and plans to mutilate the Widow #X_1#. #X_0#’s predominant motivation is revenge. Half Native American and half Caucasian, he has suffered social exclusion, probably because of his race.

-- #X_0# --
A hapless drunk and friend of #X_2#. #X_0# is kind and grateful toward #X_4# and #X_1#, who bring him presents after he is wrongly jailed for Dr. #X_3#’s murder. #X_0#’s naïve trust eventually pushes #X_4#’s conscience to the breaking point, compelling #X_4# to tell the truth at #X_0#’s trial about who actually committed the murder.

-- #X_0# --
A respected local physician. #X_0# shows his more sordid side on the night of his murder: he hires #X_2# and #X_3# to dig up #X_1# grave because he wants to use the corpse for medical experiments.

-- #X_0# --
The minister of the town church.

-- #X_0# --
A kindhearted, pious resident of #Y_0# whom the children recognize as a friend. #X_4# knows that the #X_0# #X_0# will give him and #X_2# ice cream and let them sleep over. She is kind to #X_3# even before she learns that he saved her life.

-- #X_0# --
A Welshman who lives with his sons near the Widow #X_1#’s house. #X_0# responds to #X_2#’s alarm on the night that #X_3# intends to attack the widow, and he takes care of #X_2# in the aftermath.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The somewhat ridiculous Sunday school superintendent. Because he aspires to please Judge #X_1#, #X_0# rewards #X_2# with a Bible, even though he knows that #X_2# hasn’t earned it.

-- #X_0# --
The schoolmaster. #X_0# seems a slightly sad character: his ambition to be a medical doctor has been thwarted and he has become a heavy drinker and the butt of schoolboy pranks.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the Aeneid. Aeneas is a survivor of the siege of #Y_1#, a city on the coast of Asia Minor. His defining characteristic is piety, a respect for the will of the gods. He is a fearsome warrior and a leader able to motivate his men in the face of adversity, but also a man capable of great compassion and sorrow. His destiny is to found the Roman race in #Y_0# and he subordinates all other concerns to this mission. The Aeneid is about his journey from #Y_1# to #Y_0#, which enables him to fulfill his fate.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the Aeneid. #X_0# is a survivor of the siege of Troy, a city on the coast of Asia Minor. His defining characteristic is piety, a respect for the will of the gods. He is a fearsome warrior and a leader able to motivate his men in the face of adversity, but also a man capable of great compassion and sorrow. His destiny is to found the Roman race in #Y_0# and he subordinates all other concerns to this mission. The Aeneid is about his journey from Troy to #Y_0#, which enables him to fulfill his fate.

-- #X_0# --
The queen of Carthage, a city in northern Africa, in what is now #Y_0#, and lover of Aeneas. #X_0# left the land of Tyre when her husband was murdered by Pygmalion, her brother. She and her city are strong, but she becomes an unfortunate pawn of the gods in their struggle for Aeneas’s destiny. Her love for Aeneas proves to be her downfall. After he abandons her, she constructs a funeral pyre and stabs herself upon it with Aeneas’s sword.

-- #X_0# --
The ruler of the Rutulians in #Y_0#. #X_0# is Aeneas’s major antagonist among mortals. He is Lavinia’s leading suitor until Aeneas arrives. This rivalry incites him to wage war against the Trojans, despite Latinus’s willingness to allow the Trojans to settle in #Y_1# and #X_0#’s understanding that he cannot successfully defy fate. He is brash and fearless, a capable soldier who values his honor over his life.

-- #X_0# --
Aeneas’s young son by his first wife, Creusa. #X_0# (also called Iulus) is most important as a symbol of Aeneas’s destiny—his future founding of the Roman race. Though still a child, #X_0# has several opportunities over the course of the epic to display his bravery and leadership. He leads a procession of boys on horseback during the games of Book V and he helps to defend the Trojan camp from Turnus’s attack while his father is away.

-- #X_0# --
Aeneas’s father, and a symbol of Aeneas’s Trojan heritage. Although #X_0# dies during the journey from Troy to Italy, he continues in spirit to help his son fulfill fate’s decrees, especially by guiding Aeneas through the underworld and showing him what fate has in store for his descendants.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The king of the Latins, the people of what is now central #Y_0#, around the Tiber River. #X_0# allows Aeneas into his kingdom and encourages him to become a suitor of Lavinia, his daughter, causing resentment and eventually war among his subjects. He respects the gods and fate, but does not hold strict command over his people.

-- #X_0# --
Latinus’s daughter and a symbol of #Y_0# in general. #X_0#’s character is not developed in the poem; she is important only as the object of the Trojan-Latin struggle. The question of who will marry #X_0#—Turnus or Aeneas—becomes key to future relations between the Latins and the Trojans and therefore the Aeneid’s entire historical scheme.

-- #X_0# --
Queen of Laurentum (a region of Latium, in #Y_0#) and wife of Latinus. #X_0# opposes the marriage of Lavinia, her daughter, to Aeneas and remains loyal throughout to Turnus, Lavinia’s original suitor. #X_0# kills herself once it is clear that Aeneas is destined to win.

-- #X_0# --
King of Pallanteum (a region of Arcadia, in #Y_0#) and father of #X_2#. #X_0# is a sworn enemy of the Latins, and Aeneas befriends him and secures his assistance in the battles against Turnus.

Son of Evander, whom Evander entrusts to Aeneas’s care and tutelage. #X_0# eventually dies in battle at the hands of Turnus, causing Aeneas and Evander great grief. To avenge #X_0#’s death, Aeneas finally slays Turnus, dismissing an initial impulse to spare him.

-- #X_0# --
A Latin leader who desires an end to the Trojan-Latin struggle. #X_0# questions the validity of #X_1#’s motives at the council of the Latins, infuriating #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The leader of the Volscians, a race of warrior maidens. #X_0# is perhaps the only strong mortal female character in the epic.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s sister. #X_1# provokes #X_0# into inducing a full-scale battle between the Latins and the Trojans by disguising herself as an officer and goading the Latins after a treaty has already been reached.

-- #X_0# --
A Trojan and a personal friend of Aeneas.

-- #X_0# --
The queen of the gods, the wife and sister of Jupiter, and the daughter of Saturn. #X_0# (#X_1# in Greek mythology) hates the Trojans because of the Trojan #Y_1#’s judgment against her in a beauty contest. She is also a patron of #Y_0# and knows that Aeneas’s Roman descendants are destined to destroy #Y_0#. She takes out her anger on Aeneas throughout the epic, and in her wrath acts as his primary divine antagonist.

-- #X_0# --
The goddess of love and the mother of Aeneas. #X_0# (Aphrodite in Greek mythology) is a benefactor of the Trojans. She helps her son whenever #X_1# tries to hurt him, causing conflict among the gods. She is also referred to as Cytherea, after Cythera, the island where she was born and where her shrine is located.

-- #X_0# --
The king of the gods, and the son of Saturn. While the gods often struggle against one another in battles of will, #X_0#’s will reigns supreme and becomes identified with the more impersonal force of fate. Therefore, #X_0# (also known as Jove, and called #X_1# in Greek mythology) directs the general progress of Aeneas’s destiny, ensuring that Aeneas is never permanently thrown off his course toward #Y_0#. #X_0#’s demeanor is controlled and levelheaded compared to the volatility of Juno and Venus.

-- #X_0# --
God of the sea, and generally an ally of Venus and Aeneas. #X_0# (Poseidon in Greek mythology) calms the storm that opens the epic and conducts Aeneas safely on the last leg of his voyage.

-- #X_0# --
The messenger god. The other gods often send #X_0# (Hermes in Greek mythology) on errands to Aeneas.

-- #X_0# --
The god of the winds, enlisted to aid #X_2# in creating bad weather for the Trojans in Book I.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
One of the Furies, or deities who avenge sins, sent by #X_1# in Book VII to incite the Latin people to war against the Trojans.

-- #X_0# --

The river god associated with the Tiber River, where Rome will eventually be built. At #X_0#’s suggestion, Aeneas travels upriver to make allies of the Arcadians.

The father of the gods. #X_0# (Chronos in Greek mythology) was king of Olympus until his son Jupiter overthrew him.

-- #X_0# --
The goddess who protects the Greeks during the Trojan War and helps them conquer #Y_1#. Like Juno, #X_0# (#X_1# in Greek mythology) is motivated against the Trojans by the Trojan #Y_0#’s judgment that Venus was the most beautiful among goddesses.

-- #X_0# --
A son of Jupiter and god of the sun. #X_0# was born at Delos and helps the Trojans in their voyage when they stop there. Because he is often portrayed as an archer, many characters invoke his name before they fire a shaft in battle.

-- #X_0# --
The hero of #X_2#’s Odyssey, and one of the captains of the Greek army that takes Troy. #X_0# (Odysseus in Greek lore), like Aeneas, must make a long and treacherous voyage before he finds home again, and references to his whereabouts in the Aeneid help situate Aeneas’s wanderings in relation to #X_0#’.

-- #X_0# --
The greatest of the Greek warriors. #X_0# slew the Trojan hero #X_2# during the war and is the tragic hero of the Iliad.

-- #X_0# --
The greatest of the Trojan warriors, killed at Troy. #X_0# is in some ways a parallel figure to Turnus, who also defends his native city to the death.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s wife, who survives the siege of #Y_1#. #X_0# meets #X_1# in his wanderings, tells him her story, and advises his course to #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A Trojan prince, son of #X_7# and #X_2#, and brother of #X_1#. The handsomest of men, #X_0# is asked to judge which goddess is most beautiful: #X_8#, #X_4#, or #X_6#. #X_8# promises him #X_3# as his wife in exchange for his judgment, so #X_0# selects #X_8#. This selection inspires the permanent wrath of #X_4# against the Trojans. Stealing #X_3# from her Greek husband, #X_5#, #X_0# provokes the Trojan War.

-- #X_0# --
The most beautiful of mortal women and wife of Menelaus. #X_0#’s abduction to #Y_1# by #Y_0# sparks the Trojan War.

-- #X_0# --
The King of Argos, the husband of Clytemnestra, and the commander of the Greek armies during the siege of Troy. #X_0# is the older brother of Menelaus, whose wife Helen was stolen by a Trojan prince, thus igniting a decade-long war. A great warrior, he sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia in order to obtain a favorable wind to carry the Greek fleet to Troy. During the ten-year conflict, his Queen has plotted his death in order to avenge the killing of their daughter. He appears on stage only briefly, and behaves arrogantly. He goes to his death unaware of his fate.

-- #X_0# --
The play's protagonist, #X_0# is Agamemnon's wife and has ruled Argos in his absence. She plans his murder with ruthless determination, and feels no guilt after his death; she is convinced of her own rectitude and of the justice of killing the man who killed her daughter. She is, a sympathetic character in many respects, but the righteousness of her crime is tainted by her entanglement with Aegisthus. Even so, Aeschylus makes it clear that Agamemnon's death must be avenged.

-- #X_0# --
The elder citizens of Argos, who were too old to fight in the Trojan War. They serve as advisors to Queen Clytemnestra during Agamemnon's absence, and provide commentary on the action of the play.

-- #X_0# --
A Trojan priestess, captured by Agamemnon and carried to Argos as his slave and mistress. She was Apollo's lover. Apollo gave her the gift of prophecy, but when she refused to bear him a child, he punished her by making all around her disbelieve her predictions.

-- #X_0# --
The novel's protagonist. #X_0# is a wealthy young lawyer married to the beautiful debutante #X_3# Welland. He is in love, however, with #X_3#'s cousin Countess #X_1# Olenska, who represents to him the freedom missing from the suffocating environment of the #Y_0# aristocracy. #X_0# is torn between his duty to #X_3# and to his family, and his passion for #X_1#.

A stereotypically handsome, athletic, and popular boy who was #X_2#’s boyfriend before #X_1#’s accident. He continues to pursue #X_2#, but not in an aggressive or threatening way. Just as #X_2# did, he seems to hang out with his crowd out of habit. There is more to #X_0# than meets the eye.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s girlfriend. She is quick to join in and jeer #X_1# but is more of a follower than an instigator. #X_0# is eager to blend in with the popular crowd to distract others from her own struggles with bulimia and depression. Under the tough-girl veneer, she has the capacity for kindness.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#’s best friends. #X_0# is easygoing about his prowess at baseball and takes most everything in stride. He asks little of #X_1# and is always there to support him without judgment.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s other best friend. Like #X_2#, #X_0# is not a status seeker, but she does have meaningful friendships that she values. She is wise and even-keeled and a writer like #X_4#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s former friend from middle school and now his nemesis. He is always the first one to call #X_2# a freak or pick a fight with him. Along with #X_2#’s father, #X_3# is the most deliberately cruel character.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s guidance counselor. He is a kind man who genuinely cares about the students but lacks the tools to recognize how deep #X_1#’s troubles run.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s guidance counselor. She has met with #X_2# many times since #X_2#’s sister’s death. At each meeting, she follows the same script of questions with the vain hope of getting #X_2# to open up. She is likely perceptive enough to know what #X_2#’s troubles are and how to help her, but her technique is to lead #X_2# to her own conclusions.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s father and a former professional hockey player. He left #X_0#’s mother when #X_0# was ten. Mr. #X_0#’s abusive behavior still haunts #X_0#’s mother, and he continues to verbally berate and physically assault #X_0#, who tells #X_3#’s parents and Mr. #X_2# that his father is dead. Mr. #X_0# tries his best to keep up appearances, but his rage is always simmering beneath the surface.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#, #X_3#, and #X_1#’s mother. Presumably still Mrs. #X_2#, but no one refers to her by name. Her years in an abusive marriage have left her skittish, and her second job at the bookstore leaves little time for her to be with or keep an eye on her three children. She loves her children but is in denial about #X_0# mental well-being, and unable to do the emotional work of helping her troubled son.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s older sister, the same age as #X_2#. #X_0# is by default the mother to her two younger siblings and covers for #X_0#’s extended absences by deceiving both the school and their parents. She loves #X_0# and is initially wary of #X_3#. She share’s #X_0#’s opinion of their father and his new family. While she supports #X_0# in a more active way than their mother, she shares her tendency to dismiss the many red flags in his behavior.

-- #X_0# --
The youngest #X_2# sister, age 8. #X_0# is old enough to suspect that her father is not a good person, but young enough that #X_2# and #X_3# try to convince her otherwise. She is at a tender age to be spending so much time without her parents.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father, seldom referred to by name. He is a loving, if grieving, father and husband, though likely to abandon his sunny mood when the situation warrants action.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s unnamed mother. Like her husband, she tries to put on a brave face for #X_1# and make things as normal as possible. The two are a united front regarding parental decisions as well, though it is #X_0# who instigates a tender, one-on-one talk with #X_1# after she lashes out at her parents.

-- #X_0# --
The #Y_0# geography teacher who assigns his students the #Y_1# project. He is the one person who does not allow #X_1# to wield her grief as an excuse to bow out of her assignments.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s Russian Literature teacher, who allows her to opt out of assignments.

-- #X_0# --
#X_5# #X_3#'s political right-hand man, the narrator of the novel and in many ways its protagonist. #X_0# comes from a prominent family (the town he grew up in, #X_0#'s Landing, was named for his ancestors), and knows many of the most important people in the state. Despite his aristocratic background, #X_0# allies himself with the liberal, amoral Governor #X_3#, to the displeasure of his family and friends. He uses his considerable skills as a researcher to uncover the secrets of #X_5#'s political enemies. #X_0# was once married to #X_2#, but has left her by the time of the novel. #X_0#'s main characteristics are his intelligence and his curious lack of ambition; he seems to have no agency of his own, and for the most part he is content to take his direction from #X_5#. #X_0# is also continually troubled by the question of motive and responsibility in history: he quit working on his PhD thesis in history when he decided he could not comprehend #X_1# motives. He develops the Great #X_4# theory to convince himself that no one can be held responsible for anything that happens. During the course of the novel, however, #X_0# rejects the Great #X_4# theory and accepts the idea of responsibility.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4# Burden's boss, who rises from poverty to become the governor of his state and its most powerful political figure. #X_0# takes control of the state through a combination of political reform (he institutes sweeping liberal measures designed to tax the rich and ease the burden on the state's many poor farmers) and underhanded guile (he blackmails and bullies his enemies into submission). While #X_4# is intelligent and inactive, #X_0# is essentially all motive power and direction. The extent of his moral philosophy is his belief that everyone and everything is bad, and that moral action involves making goodness out of the badness. #X_0# is married to Lucy #X_0#, with whom he has a son, #X_8#. But his voracious sexual appetite leads him into a number of affairs, including one with #X_7# and one with #X_3#. #X_0# is murdered by #X_2# toward the end of the novel.

-- #X_0# --

But two revelations combine to shatter #X_0#'s worldview: he learns that his father illegally protected Judge #X_2# after he took a bribe, and he learns that his sister has become #X_6# Stark's lover. Driven mad with the knowledge, #X_0# assassinates #X_6# in the lobby of the #Y_0# towards the end of the novel.

-- #X_0# --

(In return for the money, the judge dismissed a case against #Y_4#, a sister corporation to #Y_0#.) When he confronts the judge with this information, the judge commits suicide; when #X_1# learns of the suicide from his mother, he also learns that #X_0# #X_0# was his real father.

-- #X_0# --
#X_7# Stark's secretary, and also his mistress. #X_0# has been with #X_7# from the beginning, and believes that she made him what he is. Despite the fact that he is a married man, she becomes extremely jealous of his relationships with other women, and they often have long, passionate fights. #X_0# is tough, cynical, and extremely vulnerable; when #X_7# announces that he is leaving her to go back to #X_4#, she tells #X_5# Duffy in a fit of rage that #X_7# is sleeping with #X_3#. #X_5# tells #X_2#, who assassinates #X_7#. Believing herself to be responsible for #X_7#'s death, #X_0# checks into a sanitarium.

-- #X_0# --
Lieutenant-Governor of the state when #X_4# is assassinated. Fat, obsequious, and untrustworthy, #X_0# swallows #X_4#'s abuse and contempt for years, but finally tells #X_1# Stanton that #X_4# is sleeping with #X_3#. When #X_1# murders #X_4#, #X_0# becomes Governor.

After the Scholarly Attorney leaves her, she marries a succession of men (the Tycoon, the Count, the Young Executive). #X_0# realization that she is capable of love--and that she really loved Judge #X_2#--helps him put aside his cynicism at the end of the novel.

-- #X_0# --
A sixteen-year-old man; the central figure in All the Pretty Horses. We know almost nothing about #X_0#'s physical appearance, only that by the end of the novel he is badly scarred across the face and chest. Laconic and pensive, he seems prematurely aged. He lives his life according to a strict, almost ritualistic code, valuing honor, intelligence, responsibility, justice, loyalty, and skill. Above all other things, he loves horses, with which he is preternaturally gifted, and the cowboy life, the solitude and dignity of the West. The novel follows #X_0#'s journey as he flees the #Y_1# ranch on which he grew up and travels with his companions #X_3# and #X_2# south into #Y_0#; on a psychological level, it depicts what happens to #X_0#'s romantic vision of the West.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is John Grady #X_1#'s best friend and his companion on the trip into #Y_0#. We know little about #X_0# physically, just that at age seventeen he is tall and thin, with long arms. #X_0# is louder, more impatient and less introspective than #X_1#; he is also the less intelligent and less skilled member of the partnership. While he is faithful to #X_1#, he does not subscribe to #X_1#'s code of absolute loyalty and strictly moral action, and he lacks the iron will that drives #X_1# to tirelessly pursue his romantic dreams. #X_0# and #X_1# stick together until their ordeal in the Mexican jail: afterwards, #X_0# returns to #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A thirteen-year-old runaway who follows #X_1# and #X_2# to #Y_0#. His real name, which is not #X_0#, is never revealed. He is hypersensitive to mockery and insult, anything impinging on his dignity.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of #X_4#, the owner of the Mexican ranch on which John Grady #X_3# and #X_6# find work. She is quite beautiful: dark- haired, blue-eyed, pale and thin. There is always an attitude of sorrow about her, of tragedy waiting to happen. #X_0# and #X_3# fall in love and start an illicit affair. The discovery of the affair results in #X_4# turning #X_3# in to the Mexican police. When #X_3# returns from jail he spends one more passionate, tragic day with #X_0#: but she cannot bring herself to abandon her family and follow him to #Y_0#. She has been manipulated by her cynical great-aunt, #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --

He is impressed by #X_3#, and promotes him to the position of breeder. But when he discovers that #X_3# has been having an illicit affair with his daughter #X_1#, #X_0#is unforgiving, turning the Americans over to the lawless Mexican police. It is for fear of losing #X_0# #X_0#'s love--as well as for fear of her scheming great-aunt #X_2#'s manipulative power- -that #X_1# abandons #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_1#'s grandaunt. She lives at the ranch of her nephew, #X_3#. An intelligent and intuitive student of human nature, #X_0# had an aristocratic upbringing and a cosmopolitan, European education. In her youth she was what she calls a "freethinker," allied with the forces that would bring about the Mexican civil war on behalf of the oppressed and poverty-stricken working class. She fell in love with one of the revolutionary leaders, but was prevented from marrying him by her disapproving family. Her personal sorrows, instead of making her more sensitive, have made her cynical and manipulative. It is she who pays the bribe to get #X_2# and #X_4# out of jail, but at the price of making #X_1# swear never to see #X_2# again.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a cowboy who works on #X_5# ranch with John Grady #X_4#. He is the brother of the ranch's foreman, #X_3#.

Later, after accepting a bribe from the charro, a relative of the man #X_1# killed, the captain murders #X_1#. When #X_2# returns after being released from prison, he takes the captain as his hostage. #X_0# captain exemplifies the corruption and cruelty rampant in this lawless part of #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
We never learn the name of #X_0# #X_0# #X_0# #X_0#. At the beginning of the novel, #X_0# #X_0# is dying, possibly of lung cancer (although we never find out for certain). The #X_0# was a prisoner of war during World War II, and came back from it a changed man; afterward, he and #X_0# #X_0#'s mother--a flighty, promiscuous women who ran off to become an actress--were never reunited. He is a lonely, silent man.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0# #X_0# nameless #X_0# appears only in the opening pages of the novel, and only briefly. #X_0# #X_0#'s #X_0# has divorced #X_0# #X_0#'s father; their marriage was never strong, and for a while during his infancy and early childhood, #X_0# #X_0#'s #X_0# left him to be raised by #X_4#. At the time the narrative begins, #X_0# #X_0#'s #X_0# is only thirty-six years old, and wants to start another life away from the solitude of the ranch, which has become lonely and unprofitable. She and her son are virtual strangers.

A young German soldier fighting in the trenches during World War I. #X_0# is the protagonist and narrator of the novel. He is, at heart, a kind, compas-sionate, and sensitive young man, but the brutal expe-rience of warfare teaches him to detach himself from his feelings. His account of the war is a bitter invective against sentimental, romantic ideals of warfare.

-- #X_0# --
A soldier belonging to #X_2#’s company and #X_2#’s best friend in the army. #X_1#, as he is known, is forty years old at the beginning of the novel and has a family at home. He is a resourceful, inventive man and always finds food, clothing, and blankets whenever he and his friends need them.

The protagonist of the novel. A 55-year-old editor of an intellectual magazine in #X_8#, #Y_0#, #X_0# has a mustache and a gray-speckled full head of hair and he wears glasses. #X_0# is engaged to Mrs. #X_7#, a wealthy widow who funds the magazine he edits. A widower himself, #X_0# lost his wife and young son many years ago. He feels guilty about these loses and wonders what life experience he has missed by not having a wife or child. Mrs. #X_7# has sent #X_0# to #Y_1# to find her son, #X_3# #X_7#, and bring him back to #Y_0#. Once he returns with #X_3#, she will marry #X_0#. She chose #X_0# as an ambassador not only because he is an old, trusted family friend but also to test his loyalty to the #X_7# family. If he were to marry Mrs. #X_7#, #X_0# would come into a great fortune and secure his status in the upper-class community in #X_8#. To some degree, Mrs. #X_7# wants to make sure that #X_0# is worthy of both the wealth and the social status.      Compulsively self-reflexive, #X_0# quickly realizes that his life in #X_8# has entrenched him in boring routine. As he travels, #X_0# comes to appreciate the freedom and openness he finds in Europe, and he begins to feel as if his new, full European life makes up for many years of personal stagnation. #X_0# takes to warning everyone he meets that they may turn out like him—old and inexperienced—if they do not live life to the fullest while they are young. #X_0# is predisposed favorably toward most people: he finds a close friend in #X_5#, a type of protégé in little #X_2#, a replacement son in #X_3#, and a feminine ideal in Madame #X_6#. At the end of the novel, #X_0# chooses to return to #X_8#, but his outlook on life is forever changed by his late-in-life experience in Europe.

-- #X_0# --
The focus of the novel and the reason for #X_3#’s visit to #Y_0#. #X_1# is a handsome, debonair, and independently wealthy bachelor currently involved in a love affair with the older Madame #X_2#. At first, it seems that #Y_0# affects #X_1# in only positive ways: #X_1# has grown from the callow, immature boy he was in #Y_1# into a polished, gentleman, comfortable in #Y_0#ian high society and often host to a wide, interesting group of friends. But #X_1# has no real attachment to Europe or to his lover. Instead, #X_1# subscribes to the American ideals of monetary success and to the social status that comes along with it. He wants to return to #Y_2# to take over the family business, even after #X_3# encourages him to stay in Europe. #Y_0# affects #X_1# only superficially, and he looks forward to returning home to #Y_1# after his enjoyable, but not profound, experience in Europe.

-- #X_0# --
A 33-year-old, unmarried expatriate who lives in #Y_1# and works as an informal “guide” to Europe for American visitors. Miss #X_0# takes an immediate liking to #X_1# when they first meet in #Y_0#. Separate from the #X_2# society, she offers #X_1# keen and objective analysis of situations and people, and #X_1# relies on her wise counsel. Although she is young and sprightly, she is more world-weary, more socially skeptical, and warier of people’s motives than #X_1#. She knows Madame #X_3# from a school they attended as young women but steadfastly avoids reacquainting herself with the other woman. At the end of the novel, she all but declares her love for #X_1#, who rejects her in favor of returning to #Y_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The ol#X_0#r woman with whom #X_1# #X_6# has become involved in a love affair. #X_0# #X_0# #X_0# has lived apart from her “brute” husband for years. At age 15, she atten#X_0#d school with #X_4# Gostrey, but they have not seen each other for a long time and #X_4# avoids contact with her. Now, at around age 38, #X_0# #X_0# #X_0# has become socially distinguished, handsome, and so cultured that she casts a shadow on #X_7#’s memory of Mrs. #X_6#. Deeply in love with #X_1#, #X_0# #X_0# #X_0# resolves to keep #X_1# in Europe—and in her life. She captivates #X_7#, and he believes that her effect on #X_1# has been only positive. He vows to help her by trying to convince #X_1# to stay in Europe, even after #X_7# learns that #X_1# and #X_0# #X_0# #X_0# have misled him about the nature of their relationship. #X_0# #X_0# #X_0# uses her beautiful daughter, Jeanne #X_0# #X_0#, much like a prop in her attempts to keep #X_7# on her si#X_0#.

-- #X_0# --
An older, widowed, wealthy matriarch to whom #X_6# is engaged. Even though #X_0# never actually appears in the novel, she drives the novel’s action and its significant events. She sends #X_6# to Europe to collect her son, #X_2#, and return him to the family business in #Y_2#. When #X_6# fails in his ambassadorial mission, she sends new ambassadors: her daughter, #X_5#; her daughter’s husband, #X_3#; and #X_3#’s sister, #X_4#. #X_0# represents the world of #Y_1#, #Y_0#, and the life that #X_6# has left behind. #X_6# thinks constantly about #X_0#, and she occupies a large place in his conscience, since she asked #X_6# to carry out her wishes in Europe and #X_6# has failed to do so for complicated reasons. Through #X_6#’s eyes, #X_0# is beautiful but deliberately so, wise but incredibly stubborn, and kind but undeniably dominant in relation to him. The interplay between #X_0#’s wishes and #X_6#’s evolving needs often drives the novel.

-- #X_0# --
An old friend of #X_3#’s who has been living, unhappily, in Europe for an unspecified amount of time. #X_0# is married but has long lived away from his wife. He is impulsive and curmudgeonly and finds nothing in Europe to his liking. He maintains close ties to #X_4# and reveals himself as a close friend of and consistent ally to #X_2# when she comes to #Y_0# to fetch #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
An expatriate artist and one of #X_2#’s closest friends in #Y_0#. Because he is physically small, he uses both of his last names and goes by “little #X_0#.” A friendly, unpretentious young man, he maintains his loyalty to #X_2# even as he develops a close bond with #X_3#. Ultimately, little #X_0# lies to #X_3# about the nature of #X_2#’s relationship with Madame #X_4# to protect #X_2#. #X_3# finds #X_0# to be gentle and treats him like the adult son he never had. Their conversations prompt #X_3# to articulate some of the most profound life lessons he has learned in Europe.

-- #X_0# --
Madame Marie #X_0# #X_0#’s charming and beautiful daughter. #X_0# is impressively refined but lacks maturity. She has great fondness for #X_1#, but not romantic love. He and Madame #X_0# #X_0# play up #X_0#’s merits in an effort to distract #X_3# from the truth of their relationship. #X_3# sees the well-raised #X_0# as proof of Madame #X_0# #X_0#’s virtue and suitability.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s older, married sister. #X_0# is in charge of the second batch of ambassadors sent to retrieve #X_2# from Europe. According to #X_4#, #X_0# has less charm and less beauty than her mother, but she is still amiable and pretty. To a great degree, #X_0# stands in for Mrs. #X_3#, who never appears in the novel. #X_0# arrives in Europe with her mother’s wishes firmly in mind and finds fault with much of what has impressed #X_4# about European life. They clash almost immediately.

-- #X_0# --
The “of-the-minute” society girl in #X_6#, #Y_0#. #X_5# finds #X_0# to be as physically beautiful as the girls in Europe, as well as more sincere and sociable than most #X_6# society girls. Mrs. #X_4# hopes #X_0# will marry #X_2#. To Mrs. #X_4#, the fact that #X_0# is Jim #X_0#’s sister, and thus already technically part of the family, only makes her more desirable. #X_0# has known #X_2# since childhood, but no romance exists between them. While in Europe, #X_0# falls for little #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A leading #Y_1# businessman who is married to Sarah #X_0# (neé #X_1#). Even though #X_0# is a prominent figure in #Y_1#, he is only technically a member of high society. Casual and relatively simple, he takes no interest in the social maneuverings of the women and wants only to enjoy himself as much as possible, especially in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_3# and little #X_2#. #X_0# is a proper American socialite, and she helps present #X_3# in a good light by virtue of her own elegance. Later #X_0# befriends #X_4# as well.

-- #X_0# --
A famous French sculptor, #X_0# is part of #X_3#’s social set in #Y_0#. His grace impresses #X_4#, but he fails to connect with #X_4# on a personal level. Little #X_2# admires #X_0#’s fame, artistic talent, and status in society.

-- #X_0# --
The man who is to marry Jeanne #X_0# Vionnet.

-- #X_0# --
The novel's hero and protagonist. #X_0# is a "superlative American": tall, pleasant, temperate, liberal, athletic, independent, and direct—a self- made success full of the "easy magnificence of his manhood." Forced to earn a living at a young age, #X_0# has accumulated a substantial fortune through a combination of diligence and luck. Now forty-two, he travels to #Y_1# to enjoy the fruits of his labors and to find a wife to complete his fortune. He is simple in some respects, inquisitive but interested only in "the best" of any genre—as evidenced by his opening marathon tour of the #Y_0#—not out of elitism, but rather a genuine curiosity to see what others consider superlative. #X_0# is curious at, but unimpressed with, the intricate #Y_1#ian social system—an attitude that causes him trouble. Yet, though often unaware of what he has provoked, #X_0# is far from a simplistic hero. His moral reasoning, honest love, and unfailing allegiance mark him as mature, consistent and self-aware, even out of his element.

-- #X_0# --
An old acquaintance of #X_2#'s who briefly served with him in the Civil War before moving to #Y_0# six years before the novel begins. #X_0# lives on the Avenue d'Iéna, the wealthy American district, with his wife #X_1# and their several children. He is dull, unaware and unappreciative of artistic or personal genius, preferring to spend his time in #Y_1# smoking and thinking about clothes, style, cigars and card games with other Americans. Yet he is no patriot, and rails against #Y_2# so often that #X_2#, a reluctant patriot, is forced to come to the country's defense. In his least sympathetic moments, #X_0# is openly dismissive and disdainful of his intelligent wife's opinions, recommendations, witticisms and sensibilities, much to #X_2#'s dismay.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# #X_0#'s wife and #X_2#'s first friend and advocate in #Y_0#. Mrs. #X_0# is intelligent, well-spoken, graceful, and compassionate, but her marriage to the boorish #X_3# has left her somewhat incomplete. She is neither beautiful nor truly brave, lacking the brazen courage to acquire the renown, reputation and admiration that real beauty would easily give. Nonetheless, she is a deeply sympathetic character and one of the novel's most human women: morally honest, loving, disappointed, romantic, full of unspent wit and dreams. #X_2# instantly likes her, and she is immediately taken by him. It is Mrs. #X_0# who first discerns #X_2#'s wish to marry, and suggests her childhood friend, #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A charming, fearless, free-spirited, and ruthless Parisian copyist whose #X_6# #X_4# agrees to buy. #X_0# is acutely aware of her many charms and can use them tirelessly to her advantage, able to play a part at a moment's notice or coax more from the men in her life than they might have meant to give. #X_5# declares her "capable of seeing a man strangled without changing colour." #X_0# habitually humiliates her father, M. #X_0#, sending him on menial errands, berating his mistakes, and giving him an occasional stipend gleaned from her rich admirers. When #X_5# and #X_2# agree to duel over her, she is thrilled, caring little for the loss of life. Yet #X_0#'s implicit cruelty stems less from sadism than ambition, her willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for the sacred end of marrying well.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of the Marquis and #X_2# and the sister of #X_6# and #X_5#, also the childhood friend of Mrs. #X_4# and the beloved of #X_3#. #X_0# is #X_0#scribed as an exquisite and perfect woman: cultured, aristocratic, beautiful, and kind. At twenty-eight, she is a widow, her mother having married her off at eighteen to the rich but unsavory Comte #X_0# Cintré, primarily out of an eagerness to refill the dwindling family coffers. Though #X_0# is strong and willing to stand against her family on moral principles, she cannot ultimately fight for her own happiness. #X_3#'s courtship gives her a brief glimpse of the joy others experience, but by novel's end she comes to feel that personal satisfaction and pleasure are hopelessly vain in a world where others suffer. #X_0#'s #X_0#cision to enter the Carmelite or#X_0#r is not simply an act of #X_0#speration, but a sign that she has #X_0#dicated her life to God to re#X_0#em the family.

-- #X_0# --
The ol#X_0#r son of the #X_0# and #X_0#e, middle-aged and much ol#X_0#r than #X_2# and #X_4#. #X_0# is infinitely epicurean and accomplished, cultivating the best manners in #Y_0#. He takes after his mother the #X_0#e in looks, ambition, values, and temperament. However, though #X_0# fancies himself the male head of the household, he is little more than his mother's lackey. His role in the household, as in the mur#X_0#r, is that of accomplice, posturer and guard. Though he has inherited the #X_0#e's ethics and intense haughtiness, he does not quite have her talent for the stinging comeback or the mortal blow.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0#er son of the #X_4# and #X_4#e, brother of #X_2# and #X_7#. The charismatic and #X_9# #X_0# is a great friend to #X_6#, who sees him as the "typical, i#X_0#al Frenchman" #X_0#e is very close to #X_2# and loves and admires her tremendously, while resenting their mother and #X_7# for forcing #X_2# into a horrific marriage against her will. #X_0# also suspects that his mother and #X_7# were involved in his father the #X_4#' #X_0#ath, but he does not know how. #X_0# plays the go-between between #X_2# and #X_6#, singing #X_6#'s praises to his hesitant sister and acting as #X_6#'s advocate towards the #X_4#e and #X_7#. His motives are not entirely selfless, however, as he sees #X_6# as a means to take revenge against his mother and brother's reign of terror.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# mother of #X_6#, #X_7#, and #X_2#, born Lady #X_3#, the daughter of an English earl. #X_0# #X_0#, #X_5#'s nemesis, is completely at home in her meticulously arranged world of pedigrees and lost fortunes, a ruthless matriarch and a formidable adversary. Together, she and #X_6# run the Bellegar#X_0# household with an iron fist, first secretly killing her husband the #X_4# for attempting to prevent #X_2#'s first marriage and now scheming to manipulate #X_2# and #X_7# for the glory of the family name. #X_0# #X_0#, unmoved by her daughter's naïve wish for peace and happiness, resembles the lovely #X_2# "as an insect might resemble a flower." Yet even the #X_0#'s most appalling actions stem from a #X_0#ep sense of entitlement and of duty to the aristocratic traditions she has been given to uphold. Though #X_5# ultimately finds the #X_0# and #X_6# "sick as a pair of poisoned cats," he cannot help but admire her brazen assurance and the heroically impenetrable manner in which she receives his damning news of the #X_4#' surviving letter.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s wife, a flighty, fashionable woman who, bored with pedigrees and damp chateaux, is looking for some excitement. #X_0# #X_0# #X_0# adores music, dancing, and fashion. She flirts, pouts, and fears her husband even though she finds him dull. She attempts to establish an alliance with #X_2#—another outsi#X_0#r to the family—but her i#X_0#a of a joint venture is a secret trip to the rowdy stu#X_0#nts' ball in the Latin Quarter. Though the #X_0# #X_0# cultivates an exquisite boredom, it is difficult to imagine what would really make her satisfied or happy.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# rich, #X_0#spicable old man whom #X_1# was forced to marry at eighteen. #X_0# #X_1#'s mother the Marquise chose the Count because of his fortune, pedigree, and willingness to accept a small dowry. #X_1# was overwhelmed with disgust when she first met the Count, but by then the wedding arrangements had already been ma#X_0#. When the Count died several years later and an inquiry was ma#X_0# into his money, his business practices so horrified #X_1# that she renounced all her claims to his money.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# late father of #X_1#, #X_5#, and #X_4#, and late husband of the #X_0#e. #X_0# handsome, eloquent, and sympathetic #X_0# is reflected in #X_5# and #X_1# just as the ruthless #X_0#e is reflected in #X_4#. When the #X_0# refused to allow #X_1# to marry to the wealthy but unsavory Comte #X_0# Cintré, his wife and el#X_0#st son mur#X_0#red him at the family estate at #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
An old British nurse, formerly the maid the #X_4#e when she was still living in #Y_0# as the Lady #X_2#. #X_0# #X_0# is thin, pale, and thoroughly English, standing straight and perpetually dressed in black. She helped to raise #X_7# and #X_3#, loves them fiercely, and embraces #X_6# as someone who can give her beloved charges a chance at happiness. #X_0# #X_0# is honest, decent, observant, discreet, and completely trustworthy, and is also the only non- complicit witness to the #X_4#' murder.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#'s father, an old, minor aristocrat who has fallen on bad times. M. #X_0# has the manners but not the means of the higher classes, feeling miserable and ruined after having lost his small fortune. #X_4# continually harangues him after years of having been cuckolded by his wife. #X_0#'s decent forlornness appeals to #X_3#'s democratic instincts, and indeed all the help #X_3# gives #X_4# is meant not for her directly but to assuage her father's fears. #X_3#'s attempts ultimately prove futile, however, as #X_0# becomes progressively more bitter and resentful of his petty, prodigious and increasingly popular daughter.

-- #X_0# --
A very fat heiress whom #X_3# introduces to #X_2# as the greatest lady in #Y_0#. #X_0# #X_0# is opulent and good-spirited, a master of the conversational arts. When #X_2# decides to spill the #X_1#' secret, he goes first to the #X_0#, but is so turned off by her impenetrable wall of saccharine bon mots that he leaves abruptly without disclosing his reason for coming.

-- #X_0# --
#X_7#, #X_3#, and #X_6#'s seventh cousin, an extremely rich heir to sizable estates in #Y_1# and #Y_2#. At thirty-three, #X_0# is young, artless, and fairly simple. Though he enjoys #Y_4# and #Y_3#, he is a self-avowed Irishman lacking the subtlety, ruthless ambition, or real social sophistication of his relatives the #X_2#. The elder #X_2# are thrilled with #X_0#, hoping that he will marry #X_3# and allow them access to his non-commercial fortunes. His lack of sophistication borders on naïve honesty, as when Madame #X_8# tries to persuade him to steal #X_3# from #X_4# and he immediately tells #X_3# everything. #X_0#'s attitude it also implies childish pleasure and convenient forgetfulness, as when he consorts unashamedly with #X_5# several months after she causes the death of his cousin #X_7#.

-- #X_0# --
A large, ruddy brewer's son from #Y_0# who insults #X_2#'s honor by stealing his place in #X_1#'s opera box at a performance of Don Giovanni. The men trade insults and eventually agree to a duel. Though #X_0# is not a good shot, he manages to mortally wound #X_2# below the heart on the second firing.

-- #X_0# --
A Unitarian minister from #Y_0# with whom #X_2# falls into a tacit traveler's partnership during his tour of Europe in the summer of 1868. #X_0# is nervous, pious, and overly concerned with the gravity of life and art, living mainly on #X_1# bread and hominy. He is acutely worried by Europe, hating its oddities, impurities, and impieties but somehow feeling that it is more deeply and richly beautiful than his own feral homeland. #X_0#'s ambiguity is reflected in his relationship with #X_2#, whom he admires as one of nature's supermen even as he rejects #X_2#'s enjoyment of simple and sensual pleasures.

-- #X_0# --
A pretty, childlike Italian woman who has obtained a divorce from her abusive husband and fled to #Y_0#. Mme. #X_0# now lives hand-to-mouth in the city, perpetually looking for an apartment and relying on the kindness of others. #X_2# is sure that her story will end badly, as divorced, pretty, penniless women in nineteenth-century #Y_0# have little choice other than prostitution. Though #X_2# neither helps nor hurts Mme. #X_0#, he keeps in touch with her to satisfy his morbid curiosity about just how long her descent will take.

-- #X_0# --
One of two friends of #X_3#'s who act for him in the duel against #X_2#. #X_0#, the nephew of a distinguished Ultramontane bishop, met #X_3# when they fought together in #Y_1#. He meets #X_1# at the #Y_0# train station to take him to #X_3#'s deathbed, and irritates #X_1# with his premature eulogies the following morning.

-- #X_0# --
The second of two friends acting for #X_3# in the duel against #X_1#. #X_0# is a stout, fair man, with whom #X_2# occasionally sees #X_3# in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
- The titular #Y_0#nah and protagonist of the novel, a #Y_1#n woman who moves to #Y_0#. #X_0# is opinionated and disarmingly frank to the point that it gets her into trouble. Despite her stubbornness, #X_0#’s journey to #Y_0# is more an idea other people had for her than her own. Throughout the novel, she turns more to the markers of her true self, including her real accent, her natural hair, and eventually a return to #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
- #X_1#’s first love, a calm, thoughtful #Y_2#n man. Throughout the novel, #X_0# is attracted to authenticity and he finds #X_1#’s honesty and bluntness refreshing. As a youth, #X_0# loves the idea of #Y_0# and believes it to be the future. After seeing the obstacles #Y_2#ns must go through to succeed in #Y_0# and #Y_1#, he resolves to stay in #Y_2#. #X_0# becomes wealthy and falls into a superficial marriage with #X_2#, but never falls out of love with #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
– The son of #X_2# and #X_3#. Over the course of the novel, #X_0# grows from a bright and cheerful child to a confused and depressed teenager. He finds himself trapped between his peers’ treatment of him as a black American, and his mother’s insistence that he is not a black American.

-- #X_0# --
- #X_3#’s aunt, a doctor who immigrates to #Y_0# with her son, #X_2#. As a young woman in #Y_1#, she offers practical advice to #X_3# about growing up, but the pressures of rebuilding her life in #Y_0# dampen #X_0#’s spirit. Her willingness to allow others to control her destiny means #X_3#, though younger, often is the one to emotionally support Aunt #X_0#.

-- #X_0# --
- #X_3#’s cousin, a wealthy white man full of energy and optimism who dates #X_2#. He enjoys #X_4# #X_2# lavish gifts and taking her to exotic destinations, even making sure she is able to find employment after graduation.

The ironic commentator of the play, #X_0# stands in for the figure of the "absurdist" dramaturge: indeed she even ultimately exits the frame of the action to become its director. Her crossing between the spaces of the action and theater is prefigured by her marginal position in what #X_1# describes as the "American Scene". In her many sardonic epigrams, she will position herself—as an "old person"—at the margins of social intercourse. #X_0#'s marginality sets her apart from the spectacle before her. Notably, she is the only character to underline the fact that she is staging a masquerade, what she describes as her "act". #X_0# also defends herself against the violence of social intercourse include through "absurdist" devices—for example: her apparent deafness, senility, memory lapses, epigrammatic wit, and general obscenity. This decidedly anti-social obscenity (L. ob-scaenus, off- scene) prefigures her departure from the household, #X_0# literally becoming a commentator on the action from the outside who pointedly delivers the party up to the audience's judgment.

-- #X_0# --
An archetypal "bad mother", #X_0# is the household's sadistic disciplinarian, dismissing #X_2# and infantilizing Daddy. She recalls a number of other of #X_1#'s female characters, most notably #X_3# from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. Like #X_3#, #X_0#'s speech distinguishes itself as the most violent in the household in its strident tone, its exaggerated sarcasm, its shrillness, its scorn and derision. Her sadism runs almost entirely unchecked—certainly one of the most disturbing aspects of #X_1#'s theater is its characters' violently infantile behavior. Thus she emasculates Daddy at every turn and of course also mutilates the couple's first child—the so- called "bumble of joy"—in the course of disciplining him.

-- #X_0# --
Under #X_1#'s reign of terror, #X_0# is a negative entity—indeed, early in the play #X_1# reduces his speech to the echo of hers. Bent to #X_1#'s will, he relies on her entirely for the confirmation of his masculinity. Like #X_1#, #X_0# also displays a disturbing propensity for infantile behavior. Whereas #X_1# becomes the tyrannical sadist in her regression, however, #X_0# characteristically becomes the child needing punishment.

-- #X_0# --
A blond, Midwestern beauty, the #X_0# #X_0# describes himself as a "type"; upon their introduction, #X_2# dubs him the "American Dream". He is the product of the murder of his lost identical twin who stands against him in his physical deformity—as #X_2# notes, the party knows him as the "bumble". As he tells #X_2#, he has suffered the progressive loss of all feeling and desire, losses that, unbeknownst to him, correspond to the mutilations #X_3# inflicted on his brother to punish his bodily excesses. #X_0#se losses have left him a shell, physically perfect but a void within. Ironically, he ultimately becomes the child that #X_3# believes will provide her with satisfaction, replacing the murdered bumble.

-- #X_0# --
A caricature of the socially responsible American housewife, #X_0#is the flighty and ingenuous volunteer from #Y_0# who delivered the "bumble" to Mommy and Daddy twenty years ago and has returned, upon their request, to provide them with the "satisfaction" they deserve. Of course, she remains steadfastly ignorant of the purpose of her visit even as she remains fully aware of her shared history with the household, thereby underscoring that history's traumatic nature. In many respects she plays a role similar to #X_1#'s in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf—that of an outsider who cannot easily always follow the household's conversational games. Indeed, she almost faints as a result.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
A recently retired judge. #X_0# is a highly intelligent old man with a commanding personality. As the characters begin to realize that a murderer is hunting them, #X_0#’s experience and air of authority make him a natural leader for the group. He lays out evidence, organizes searches, and ensures that weapons are locked away safely. #X_0#’s guilt is revealed at the end of the novel in a confession that illuminates the characteristics that drive him to commit the series of murders: a strong sense of justice combined with a sadistic delight in murdering.

-- #X_0# --
A former governess who comes to Indian Island purportedly to serve as a secretary to Mrs. #X_3#. #X_0# wants to escape a past in which she killed a small boy in her care, #X_1# Hamilton, so that the man she loved would inherit #X_1#’s estate. Although the coroner cleared her of blame, #X_0#’s lover abandoned her. #X_0# is one of the most intelligent and capable characters in the novel, but she also suffers from attacks of hysteria, feels guilty about her crime, and reacts nervously to the uncanny events on the island. The “Ten Little Indians” poem has a powerful effect on her.

-- #X_0# --
A mysterious, confident, and resourceful man who seems to have been a mercenary soldier in Africa. #X_0# is far bolder and more cunning than most of the other characters, traits that allow him to survive almost until the end of the novel. His weakness is his chivalrous attitude toward women, particularly #X_1#, with whom he has a number of private conversations. He cannot think of her as a potential killer, and he underestimates her resourcefulness, which proves a fatal mistake.

-- #X_0# --
A gullible, slightly timid doctor. #X_0# often draws the suspicion of the other guests because of his medical knowledge. He is a recovering alcoholic who once accidentally killed a patient by operating on her while drunk. #X_0#, while professionally successful, has a weak personality, making him the perfect tool for the murderer. He has spent his whole life pursuing respectability and public success, and is unable to see beneath people’s exteriors.

-- #X_0# --
A former police inspector. #X_0# is a well-built man whose experience often inspires others to look to him for advice. As a policeman, he was corrupt and framed a man named #X_1# at the behest of a criminal gang. On the island, he acts boldly and frequently takes initiative, but he also makes frequent blunders. He constantly suspects the wrong person, and his boldness often verges on foolhardiness.

-- #X_0# --
An old, ruthlessly religious woman who reads her Bible every day. The recording accuses #X_0# of killing #X_1# Taylor, a servant whom she fired upon learning that #X_1# was pregnant out of wedlock. #X_1# subsequently killed herself. Unlike the other characters, #X_0# feels convinced of her own righteousness and does not express the slightest remorse for her actions.

-- #X_0# --
The dignified butler. #X_0# continues to be a proper servant even after his wife is found dead and the bodies begin piling up. The recording accuses #X_0# and his wife of letting their former employer die because they stood to inherit money from her.

-- #X_0# --
The oldest guest. #X_0# is accused of sending a lieutenant, #X_2#, to his death during World War I because #X_3# was his wife’s lover. Once the first murders take place, #X_0#, already guilt-ridden about his crime, becomes resigned to his death and sits by the sea waiting for it to come to him.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
A shady, criminal character hired by the murderer to make the arrangements for the island. #X_0# allegedly peddled drugs to a young woman and drove her to suicide.

-- #X_0# --
The book’s author, narrator, and protagonist. As the teller of his own life story, #X_0# writes from the perspective of an adolescent looking out onto the world rather than as an adult looking back on his childhood. #X_0#’s memoir therefore maintains a voice and perspective rich with the enthusiasm, tenderness, and determination of a young man.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s “Mam” is humorous and loving, not overbearing or self-pitying, despite her difficult life. As #X_0# deals with her husband’s alcoholism, the deaths of three of her children, and the necessity of begging for handouts from aid agencies, her expectations disintegrate. Despite the painful thwarting of her own hopes,  #X_0# always considers her children and their welfare above all else.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is an alcoholic who spends his wages and dole money on drink while his children starve. #X_0#’s treatment of his father remains masterfully evenhanded. He reveals not only the despair inflicted on the family by #X_0#’s drinking, but also the obvious love between #X_0# and his sons.

An old eccentric to whom #X_1# reads #X_2# satirical essay “A Modest Proposal.” #X_0# becomes a close friend of #X_1#’s, in part because he respects #X_1# and treats him like an adult.

-- #X_0# --

Another friend of #X_1#’s who shares many adventures with him.

-- #X_0# --
A school friend of #X_1#’s who lives in unbearable squalor as a child, but who eventually moves to #Y_0# in order to earn more money for his family.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s headmaster and teacher during his final year at school. “#X_2#” encourages #X_1# to go to #Y_0#  and find good employment rather than stay in a dead-end job in #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s hunchbacked friend who wants to work for the #Y_0# as a radio newsreader.

-- #X_0# --
A "word processor" who works at the federal appeals court in #Y_0#. #X_0# embodies all the stereotypes of the neurotic Jew: anxious, ambivalent and perpetually guilty. Yet that guilt does not prevent him from leaving his lover #X_2# when he contracts AIDS. #X_0#'s moral journey, from callous abandonment to genuine repentance and sorrow, is one of the key maturations in the play; his awakening of responsibility parallels the awakening that the play seeks to awaken in its audiences. #X_0#'s idealistic faith in American democracy, while often naive or self-absorbed, is similar to the faith #X_1# himself manifests, so much so that some critics call #X_0# a stand-in for the playwright.

-- #X_0# --
The boyfriend #X_1# abandons after #X_0# reveals that he has AIDS. #X_0# becomes a prophet when he is visited by an Angel of God, but he eventually rejects his prophecy and demands a blessing of additional life. The Angel is drawn to #X_0# because of his illness, which inscribes a kind of ending in his bloodstream, and because of his ancient Anglo-Saxon lineage, representing the notion of being rooted and stable. But he proves wiser than the Angels in rejecting their doctrine of stasis in favor of the painful necessity of movement and migration. #X_0# is as genuinely decent and moral as #X_1# is flawed. His AIDS infection renders him weak and victimized, but he manages to transcend that mere victimhood, surviving and becoming the center of a new, utopian community at the play's end.

-- #X_0# --
A Mormon, Republican lawyer at the appeals court, #X_0# grapples with his latent homosexuality, leaving his wife #X_1# for #X_2# and being left in turn by #X_2#. #X_2# is at first drawn to #X_0#'s ideology but ultimately turns on him because he is a conservative and an intimate of the hated #X_4# Cohn. His initial naiveté is challenged by #X_4#'s unethical behavior and his painful love affair. #X_0#'s path in the play (from self-sufficient and strong to helpless and dependent) is in some ways the opposite of #X_3#'s trajectory. The play finally seems to abandon #X_0#, excluding him from its vision of the good society because of his ideology—an omission that comes off as uncharacteristically narrow and intolerant.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s wife, a Valium-addicted agoraphobe trapped in a failing marriage who hallucinates and invents imaginary characters to escape her troubles. The perpetually fearful #X_0# obsesses about knife-wielding men and the ozone layer as a subconscious stand-in for her own difficulties. But through an inexplicable dream encounter with #X_3#, she learns that her husband is gay and begins to take control of her own destiny. Of all the major characters, #X_0# ends the play the farthest from where she began: as an independent, confident woman newly in love with life and setting off to build her own life in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A famous #Y_0# lawyer and powerbroker, #X_0# was a real-life figure whom #X_2# adapted for his play. #X_0# is the play's most vicious and disturbing character, a closeted homosexual who disavows other gays and cares only about amassing clout. His lack of ethics led him to illegally intervene in the espionage trial of #X_1#, which resulted in her execution. #X_0# represents the opposite of community, the selfishness and loneliness all too endemic to American life. However, his malevolence goes beyond mere isolation to actual hatred and evil. He is forgiven (though not exonerated) in the play's moral climax, after his death (from AIDS) unwittingly reconnects him to the gay community from which he always distanced himself.

-- #X_0# --
A black ex-drag queen and registered nurse, #X_0# is #X_2#'s best friend and—quite against #X_0#'s will—#X_3#'s caretaker. He is the most ethical and reasonable character in the play, generously looking out for #X_2#, grappling with #X_3# and rebutting #X_1#'s blindly self-centered politics. At times #X_0# feels less like an individual than a symbol of marginalized groups, particularly since most of his history and personal life are hidden from the audience. But despite these omissions he remains complex—full of hatred for #X_3#, yet possessing sufficient character and morality to forgive him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s mother, who moves from #Y_1# to #Y_0# after #X_2# confesses he is gay in a late-night phone call. #X_0# tends sternly to #X_1# but blossoms after she encounters #X_3#, becoming his companion and friend. Her chilly demeanor is melted by #X_3# and by a remarkable sexual encounter with the Angel.

-- #X_0# --
An imposing, terrifying, divine presence who descends from Heaven to bestow prophecy on #X_3#. #X_0# #X_0# seeks a prophet to overturn the migratory impulse of human beings, believing that their constant motion and change have driven #X_2# to abandon creation. Her cosmology is disturbingly reactionary, even deadly, and #X_3# successfully resists it in a visit to Heaven. This reactionary nature is rather surprisingly blended with a dramatic, #X_4#-esque speaking style and an overpowering, multigendered sexuality.

-- #X_0# --
A real-life Jewish woman who was executed for treason during the #X_3# era. The #X_0# of the play returns as a ghost to take satisfaction in the death of her persecutor, #X_4#. #X_0# hates #X_4# with a "needlesharp" passion, yet on his deathbed she musters enough compassion to sing to him. Her recitation of the Kaddish with #X_2# indicates her forgiveness.

-- #X_0# --
An elderly rabbi who delivers the eulogy at the funeral of #X_3#, #X_0# #X_0# describes the conservative process by which Jewish immigrants resisted assimilation. #X_1# seeks spiritual guidance from him, and #X_2# later encounters him in Heaven on his way to confront the Angels.

-- #X_0# --
A travel agent who resembles a jazz musician, #X_0# is one of #X_1#'s imaginary creations. She summons him whenever she wants to escape from her present surroundings, though #X_0# cautions her that there is a limit to her ability to flee from reality.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s doctor, whom #X_1# threatens with destruction lest he refer to him as a homosexual. #X_0# recognizes the folly of #X_1#'s self-delusion but ultimately gives in to it, agreeing to set down his official condition as liver cancer.

-- #X_0# --
A nurse who attends to #X_1# in the hospital. #X_0# is one of several characters who give voice to the same anti-migratory impulse as the Angel, she tells #X_1# in no uncertain terms to stay put.

-- #X_0# --
A #Y_0# official and political ally of #X_2#'s. #X_0# is fundamentally spineless, allowing #X_2# to manipulate him in order to impress #X_1# and then taking the abuse that #X_2# heaps on him along with a blackmail threat.

-- #X_0# --
A real estate agent who handles the sale of #X_2#'s house in #Y_0#. Like #X_1#, she urges her friend to settle down and remain at home.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#'s ancestors who are summoned from the dead to help prepare the way for the Angel's arrival. #X_0# #X_0# is a medieval farmer, #X_0# #X_0##X_0# a seventeenth- century Londoner who is more sophisticated and cosmopolitan in outlook. Both men died of the plague.

-- #X_0# --
The World's Oldest Living Bolshevik, who delivers the tirade that marks the beginning of Perestroika. #X_0# criticizes the pettiness of modern American life, the pointless quality of life in the absence of a governing theory.

-- #X_0# --
A dummy from the diorama at the #X_0# Visitor's Center who is silenced while her husband and son speak. #X_0# #X_0# mother comes to life, however, and accompanies #X_2# while sharing painful truths about life and change.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s grandmother, #X_0#'s funeral takes place in the first scene of Millennium. #X_3# encounters her in Heaven, playing cards with Rabbi #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist and narrator of the novel. After losing her mother at age three and her unborn child at age fifteen, #X_0#does not want to love anything for fear of losing it. She blends a fierce independence with a deep desire to find someone who will help give her life meaning. Unsure of her direction in life or of her connection to her past, #X_0#thinks of herself as an awkward outsider in #Y_0# and wherever she goes. She slowly learns that not only does she have a great deal to offer the community, but also that she is and always has been a beloved member of a large family.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# and #X_4#'s father and the person from whose perspective the secondary third person narrator interjects. Although he serves as the sole town doctor for #X_3# his entire life, #X_0# #X_0#, partly of his own volition, always feels like an outsider. Despite his gruff manner and un-communicative style, #X_0#loves his two daughters desperately. As he loses his mind to Alzheimer's disease, he also loses many of his inhibitions and is finally able to at least voice his care for and understanding of #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s younger sister who leaves for #Y_0# at the beginning of the novel. #X_0#jokingly calls herself "the luckiest person alive" not only because of her near brush with death, but also because she truly enjoys her life. Even when she faces the horrible destruction of life and land in #Y_0#, she finds enormous happiness in trying to help improve cultivation practices. Contrary to #X_1#, #X_0#feels at home absolutely anywhere.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s love interest. #X_0# would die for the land. A native american with mixed Apache, Pueblo and Navajo ancestry, #X_0# is deeply connected to his Native American roots. The calm wisdom that accompanies his understanding of the land and its cycles leads him to be a perfect partner for #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# and #X_4#'s mother. Called #X_0# only by #X_3#, she died shortly after #X_4#'s birth from complications arising from the pregnancy. Her life was characterized by her extreme stubbornness.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s lover in #Y_1#. Like #X_1#, #X_0# does not have a strong sense of connection to any one place in the world. An #Y_0# doctor, his relationships with people are characterized by their transcience. He cares a great deal about #X_1# but is not in love with her.

-- #X_0# --
The matriarch of her family and of #Y_0#, #X_0# expresses her strong beliefs in off-color remarks.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s husband. #X_3# divides his time between working on the railroad, caring for his orchard, and loving his family.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s nearest neighbor. #X_0#cares for #X_2#, #X_5#, and #X_3# over the years, and is one of #X_2#'s most important links to her childhood.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s dog. #X_0#'s extreme devotion to #X_1# stems from the way #X_1# saved him as a puppy, which demonstrates #X_1#'s connection with animals.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s oldest son. At the awkward beginning of adolescence, #X_0# is a sweet, quiet young man.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s twin brother and best friend. #X_0# died when he was fifteen. He stands for the destruction that Anglo culture has on Native American communities, as well as for the importance of the bonds between siblings.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s mother. #X_0# is a Pueblo Indian who still lives on the reservation. She symbolizes the Native American matrilineal tradition.

-- #X_0# --
The pig who emerges as the leader of #Y_0# after the Rebellion. Based on #X_1#, #X_0# uses military force (his nine loyal attack dogs) to intimidate the other animals and consolidate his power. In his supreme craftiness, #X_0# proves more treacherous than his counterpart, #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The pig who challenges #X_2# for control of #Y_0# after the Rebellion. Based on #X_1#, #X_0# is intelligent, passionate, eloquent, and less subtle and devious than his counterpart, #X_2#. #X_0# seems to win the loyalty of the other animals and cement his power.

-- #X_0# --
The cart-horse whose incredible strength, dedication, and loyalty play a key role in the early prosperity of #Y_0# and the later completion of the windmill. Quick to help but rather slow-witted, #X_0# shows much devotion to #Y_0#’s ideals but little ability to think about them independently. He naïvely trusts the pigs to make all his decisions for him. His two mottoes are “I will work harder” and “#X_1# is always right.”

-- #X_0# --
The pig who spreads #X_1#’s propaganda among the other animals. #X_0# justifies the pigs’ monopolization of resources and spreads false statistics pointing to the farm’s success. #X_2# uses #X_0# to explore the ways in which those in power often use rhetoric and language to twist the truth and gain and maintain social and political control.

-- #X_0# --
The prize-winning boar whose vision of a socialist utopia serves as the inspiration for the Rebellion. Three days after describing the vision and teaching the animals the song “Beasts of England,” #X_0# dies, leaving #X_5# and #X_3# to struggle for control of his legacy. #X_4# based #X_0# on both the German political economist #X_2# and the Russian revolutionary leader #X_6#.

-- #X_0# --
A good-hearted female cart-horse and #X_1#’s close friend. #X_0# often suspects the pigs of violating one or another of the Seven Commandments, but she repeatedly blames herself for misremembering the commandments.

-- #X_0# --
The tame raven who spreads stories of Sugarcandy Mountain, the paradise to which animals supposedly go when they die. #X_0# plays only a small role in Animal Farm, but #X_1# uses him to explore how communism exploits religion as something with which to pacify the oppressed.

-- #X_0# --
The vain, flighty mare who pulls Mr. #X_1#’s carriage. #X_0# craves the attention of human beings and loves being groomed and pampered. She has a difficult time with her new life on #Y_0#, as she misses wearing ribbons in her mane and eating sugar cubes. She represents the petit bourgeoisie that fled from #Y_1# a few years after the #Y_1#n Revolution.

-- #X_0# --
The long-lived donkey who refuses to feel inspired by the Rebellion. #X_0# firmly believes that life will remain unpleasant no matter who is in charge. Of all of the animals on the farm, he alone comprehends the changes that take place, but he seems either unwilling or unable to oppose the pigs.

-- #X_0# --
The white goat who reads the Seven Commandments to #X_2# whenever #X_2# suspects the pigs of violating their prohibitions.

-- #X_0# --
The often drunk farmer who runs #Y_1# before the animals stage their Rebellion and establish #Y_0#. #X_0# is an unkind master who indulges himself while his animals lack food; he thus represents Tsar #X_2#, whom the Russian Revolution ousted.

-- #X_0# --
The tough, shrewd operator of #Y_1#, a neighboring farm. Based on #X_1#, the ruler of Nazi #Y_0# in the 1930s and 1940s, #X_0# proves an untrustworthy neighbor.

-- #X_0# --
The easygoing gentleman farmer who runs #Y_1#, a neighboring farm. #X_0# #X_1#’s bitter enemy, #X_0# represents the capitalist governments of #Y_0# and #Y_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The human solicitor whom #X_1# hires to represent #Y_0# in human society. #X_0#’s entry into the #Y_0# community initiates contact between #Y_0# and human society, alarming the common animals.

-- #X_0# --
Two dogs, each of whom gives birth early in the novel. #X_1# takes the puppies in order to “educate” them.

-- #X_0# --
The poet pig who writes verse about #X_2# and pens the banal patriotic song “Animal Farm, Animal Farm” to replace the earlier idealistic hymn “Beasts of England,” which Old #X_1# passes on to the others.

-- #X_0# --
A beautiful, aristocratic married woman from #Y_0# whose pursuit of love and emotional honesty makes her an outcast from society. #X_0#’s adulterous affair catapults her into social exile, misery, and finally suicide. #X_0# is a beautiful person in every sense: intelligent and literate, she reads voraciously, writes children’s books, and shows an innate ability to appreciate art. Physically ravishing yet tastefully reserved, she captures the attentions of virtually everyone in high society. #X_0# believes in love—not only romantic love but family love and friendship as well, as we see from her devotion to her son, her fervent efforts to reconcile #X_5# and #X_2# Oblonsky in their marital troubles, and her warm reception of #X_2# at her country home. #X_0# abhors nothing more than fakery, and she comes to regard her husband, #X_4#, as the very incarnation of the fake, emotionless conventionality she despises.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s husband, a high-ranking government minister and one of the most important men in #Y_0#. #X_0# is formal and duty-bound. He is cowed by social convention and constantly presents a flawless façade of a cultivated and capable man. There is something empty about almost everything #X_0# does in the novel, however: he reads poetry but has no poetic sentiments, he reads world history but seems remarkably narrow-minded. He cannot be accused of being a poor husband or father, but he shows little tenderness toward his wife, #X_2#, or his son, #X_3#. He fulfills these family roles as he does other duties on his list of social obligations. #X_0#’s primary motivation in both his career and his personal life is self-preservation. When he unexpectedly forgives #X_2# on what he believes may be her deathbed, we see a hint of a deeper #X_0# ready to emerge. Ultimately, however, the bland bureaucrat remains the only #X_0# we know.

-- #X_0# --
A wealthy and dashing military officer whose love for #X_2# prompts her to desert her husband and son. #X_0# is passionate and caring toward #X_2# but clearly disappointed when their affair forces him to give up his dreams of career advancement. #X_0#, whom #X_4# originally modeled on the Romantic heroes of an earlier age of literature, has something of the idealistic loner in him. Yet there is a dark spot at the core of his personality, as if #X_4# refuses to let us get too close to #X_0#’s true nature. Indeed, #X_4# gives us far less access to #X_0#’s thoughts than to other major characters in the novel. We can never quite forget #X_0#’s early jilting of #X_3#, and we wonder whether he feels guilt about nearly ruining her life. Even so, #X_0# is more saintly than demonic at the end of the novel, and his treatment of #X_2# is impeccable, even if his feelings toward her cool a bit.

-- #X_0# --
A socially awkward but generous-hearted landowner who, along with #X_2#, is the co-protagonist of the novel. Whereas #X_2#’s pursuit of love ends in tragedy, #X_0#’s long courtship of #X_3# Shcherbatskaya ultimately ends in a happy marriage. #X_0# is intellectual and philosophical but applies his thinking to practical matters such as agriculture. He aims to be sincere and productive in whatever he does, and resigns from his post in local government because he sees it as useless and bureaucratic. #X_0# is a figurehead in the novel for #X_5# himself, who modeled #X_0# and #X_3#’s courtship on his own marriage. #X_0#’s declaration of faith at the end of the novel sums up #X_5#’s own convictions, marking the start of the deeply religious phase of #X_5#’s life that followed his completion of #X_2# Karenina.

#X_0#
(#X_1#) --
A beautiful young woman who is courted by both #X_2# and #X_5#, and who ultimately marries #X_2#. Modeled on #X_4#’s real-life wife, #X_1# is sensitive and perhaps a bit overprotected, shocked by some of the crude realities of life, as we see in her horrified response to #X_2#’s private diaries. But despite her indifference to intellectual matters, #X_1# displays great courage and compassion in the face of death when caring for #X_2#’s dying brother #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s brother, a pleasure-loving aristocrat and minor government official whose affair with his children’s governess nearly destroys his marriage. #X_5# and #X_2# share a common tendency to place personal fulfillment over social duties. #X_5# is incorrigible, proceeding from his affair with the governess—which his wife, #X_3#, honorably forgives—to a liaison with a ballerina. For #X_6#, #X_5#’s moral laxity symbolizes the corruptions of big-city #Y_0# life and contrasts with the powerful moral conscience of #X_4#. However, despite his transgressions, the affable #X_5# is a difficult character to scorn.

-- #X_0# --
#X_5#’s wife and #X_4#’s older sister. #X_3# is one of the few people who behave kindly toward #X_2# after her affair becomes public. #X_3#’s sympathetic response to #X_2#’s situation and her guarded admiration for #X_2#’s attempt to live her life fully hint at the positive aspects of #X_2#’s experience. Well acquainted with the hardships of matrimony and motherhood, #X_3# is, more than anyone else in the novel, in a position to appreciate what #X_2# has left behind by leaving with #X_6#. The novel opens with the painful revelation that #X_3#’s husband has betrayed her, and her even more painful awareness that he is not very repentant.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# and #X_2#’s young son. #X_3# is a good-natured boy, but his father treats him coldly after learning of #X_2#’s affair. #X_2# shows her devotion to #X_3# when she risks everything to sneak back into the #X_0# household simply to bring birthday presents to her son.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s sickly, thin brother. The freethinking #X_0# is largely estranged from his brothers, but over the course of the novel he starts to spend more time with #X_0#. #X_0# is representative of liberal social thought among certain Russian intellectuals of the period; his reformed-prostitute girlfriend, #X_2#, is living proof of his unconventional, radically democratic viewpoint.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s half-brother, a famed intellectual and writer whose thinking #X_2# has difficulty following. #X_0# embodies cold intellectualism and is unable to embrace the fullness of life, as we see when he cannot bring himself to propose to #X_3#.

The protagonist of the novel. #X_0# is an orphan who is adopted by #X_2# and #X_1# and grows up on their farm, Green Gables. The novel follows #X_0# as she makes social blunders and tries to quickly absorb the rules of social conduct, religion, and morality that other children have grown up learning. She has difficulty mixing these social customs with her own unique sensibilities. #X_0# is stubborn, passionate, loyal, and intelligent. She loves beauty and fantasy, and wants to be a good person.

-- #X_0# --
An unmarried woman who raises #X_1#. #X_0# lives at #Y_0# with her unmarried brother, #X_2#. #X_0# is all angles and straight lines, with a stern face and tightly knotted hair. This physical severity mirrors her moral and emotional severity. Although #X_0# does not usually express emotion, underneath she has a wry sense of humor and a loving heart. Although she raises #X_1# strictly, she loves her adopted daughter, and by the end of the novel she has become softer and more expressive.

-- #X_0# --
A sixty-year-old bachelor who lives at #Y_0# with his sister, #X_2#. #X_0# is painfully shy and a little eccentric.

A handsome, smart #Y_0# boy who becomes #X_1#’s rival when he makes the mistake of teasing her about her red hair. #X_1# swears never to speak to #X_0#, and even when he rescues her from the river, she refuses to break the silence between them. #X_1#’s rivalry with #X_0# keeps her motivated throughout her academic career. By the end of the novel, the rivalry has become affectionate, and #X_1# and #X_0# have become friends.

-- #X_0# --
The town busybody. #X_0# #X_0# likes nothing better than to give her opinion and preach morals. She lives next door to #Y_0# with her meek husband, #X_3#, and an affectionate, quarrelsome friendship exists between her and #X_2#. #X_0# #X_0# is outspoken about everything from politics to fashion, and, although childless, she never fails to advise #X_2# on how to raise #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s teacher. #X_0# #X_0# becomes the #Y_0# schoolteacher after the unpopular Mr. #X_3# departs. Her unorthodox, liberal teaching methods worry the conservative #Y_0# trustees and Mrs. #X_4#, but all of her students love her. She is a role model and mentor for #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the novel. #X_0# is bright, spunky, and witty. She tells her own story in tones that vary from serious to comic. Her struggle throughout the novel is to become a separate self. For most of the book, she wants to remain united with her mother and therefore fights the separation in every way possible. She finds substitutes with her friends and becomes disobedient. In her disobedience, she comes to define herself in a unique way that stands in contrast to the complacently demanded of other young girls in the Antiguan social order.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is a strong, capable, beautiful woman whom #X_1# admires and deeply loves. We are generally only able to see the #X_0# as #X_1# sees her, which may place her in a negative light. When #X_1# is young, her #X_0# takes complete and loving care of her. #X_0# hatred of her #X_0# grows as a result of her #X_0# saying that she is a separate being. #X_0#is marked by power in the realms of obeah, the powerful spiritual beliefs native to the Caribbean. She is brave enough to prepare a dead girl for her final rest in a coffin, but also caring enough to carefully bathe her daughter. #X_0# #X_0#'s sexuality appears to have been the cause for her departure from her home island of #Y_0# and also is one of the reasons that #X_1# grows to hate her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is a kindly, quiet man who is always pleasant to #X_1# and in the household sphere. While he is kind, the household runs according to his presence. His wife wakes up early to prepare food for him and she cooks for him throughout the day. Before marrying #X_0# mother, her #X_0# slept with other women and even #X_0#ed their children. These women occasionally harass #X_0# mother on the street. This legacy of philandering suggests his previous sexual freedom. He is approximately thirty years older than #X_0# mother and now has conveniently retired to a life of quiet domesticity. Although he appears to be a kind man, his presence carries subtle undertones of the unequal power relations between genders in the #Y_0# of #X_0# childhood.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s best friend in school. #X_1# uses her relationship with #X_0#to fill the void she feels after her mother appears to betray her. #X_0#and #X_1# become inseparable and share their secrets and stories with one another. At the same time, #X_1# senses that their friendship lacks something since the two girls cling to each other primary because of separation anxiety. After #X_1#'s illness, when she craves rather than fears separation, #X_1# realizes that her connection with #X_0#is not very meaningful. #X_0#'s docility and willingness to conform to the social order handed down by the colonial power makes her dull in #X_1#'s eyes.

-- #X_0# --
A local lower class girl whom #X_2# befriends. #X_0# #X_0# #X_0#'s life is as unstructured as #X_2#'s is structured and #X_2# wants to be like her. #X_0#only has to wash and comb her hair once a week and is allowed to run wild without parental control. #X_2# becomes a bit of a hooligan herself after befriending the #X_0# #X_0#. #X_0#y are frequently playing marbles, lying constantly, and being a petty thief. #X_0#stands as a fully defiant character who refuses to live according to the norms that the colonial society imposes on her. She has not been indoctrinated by the English social order because she does not seem to attend school. She refuses to wear the clothes established as proper by the English system and she even seems to lack a proper English name, being only referred to as the "#X_0# #X_0#." #X_2#'s willingness to interact with the #X_0# #X_0# demonstrates her own desire for defiance against the dominant social order.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s grandmother. #X_0#lives on #Y_1# but comes to #Y_0# to heal #X_2#. #X_0#is a powerful female figure who is deeply connected with the local healing religion of the island, #Y_2#. She appears to have powers outside of her self that she uses to maintain her own health and to bring #X_2#'s back to her. #X_0#is a deeply intuitive, strong woman who represents the strength of the local #Y_0#n culture and who stands apart from a Caribbean world organized according to the British social order.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s mother's father. #X_1#'s mother and he quarreled when she was young, which led #X_1#'s mother to leave home at the age of sixteen. Later in life, he becomes decrepit and unable to walk around freely. He represents oppressive male control over a family. When his son became sick, he refused to let an obeah woman treat him and after he died Ma #X_0#, his wife, never spoke to him again.

-- #X_0# --
The girl who dies after having a disease where she eats mud. #X_1#'s mother prepares #X_0#'s dead body for the funeral.

-- #X_0# --
The slowwitted girl whom #X_1# adores and pesters at school, until she discovers that #X_0#'s mother died. #X_1# no longer talks to her after that because she finds #X_0# too shameful without a mother.

-- #X_0# --
The boy that #X_1# played with when she was a young girl. He tricked her into sitting naked on a red anthill, so that she was stung all over. When she meets him later in life, she remembers this incident as a time when her mother stood up for her.

-- #X_0# --
The girl who is second in class behind #X_1#. #X_1# finds #X_0# boring and dull because #X_0# has no spunk and is very well behaved. #X_1#'s disobedience relates to her desire to defy the dominant social order, the colonial ideal handed down by the school. Because #X_0# lacks a similar desire, #X_1# finds her uninteresting.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s original homeroom teacher at school who praised #X_2#'s essay about her mother. Her surname is the same as one of the British Admirals who conquered the Caribbean, thus suggesting her place as an instructor in the colonial social order.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s history teacher at school who grows extremely upset with #X_2#'s defacing of the history book. Her name is the same as several of the British kings suggesting her place in maintaining the British social order.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s neighbor who falls down dead on the street.

-- #X_0# --
The obeah woman who moved to #Y_0# from #Y_1# and who comes to treat #X_1# during her illness.

-- #X_0# --
A street sweeper, the protagonist of the novella. #X_0# #X_0#, who later renames himself #X_1#, believes in individualism and rejects the collectivist society around him. He is vain and self-centered, strong, beautiful, and intelligent. He is deeply curious and desires freedom to explore and think, and he is unafraid of the society of mindless drones around him. #X_0#represents the superiority of a singular intellect to the homogeneity of the masses, who cannot think for themselves and are indistinguishable from one another.

-- #X_0# --
A beautiful peasant with whom #Y_0#7-2521 falls madly in love. #X_0#demonstrates her subservience to Equality 7-2521 by allowing him to change her name from Liberty 5-3000 to the #X_0# #X_0#, and later, #X_2#. #X_0#is proud and vain, strong and bitter. She loves #Y_0#7-2521 because he is different from most men around her. With him, she grapples with a desire to find the word “I” in order to express her love for him. #X_0#is relatively underdeveloped as a  character, functioning mostly as the object of  Equality 7-2521’s affection.

-- #X_0# --
A martyr for the word “I.” #X_0#suffers no pain as he is burned alive because he knows the meaning of individualism. His death foreshadows the suffering and exile of Equality 7-2521, and he represents the way to die properly, in #X_2#’s view, for the cause of egoism.

-- #X_0# --
Equality 7-2521’s only friend. #X_0# views Equality 7-2521 as a prophet. When he and Equality 7-2521 discover the tunnel in which Equality 7-2521 hides to write his journal and make his discoveries, he is torn between loyalty to his friend and his desire not to break the law. #X_0# represents the citizen who secretly seeks his own meaning but is unable to realize it because he cannot take the step of breaking with  his society.

-- #X_0# --
The leader of #Y_1# of Scholars. #X_0#is shapeless and cowardly, like all members of #Y_1#. He fears and hates #Y_0#-2521 for breaking the rules because he believes that only those decisions reached by the council can be of value. #X_0# represents the thinking force behind the evil collectivism of the city.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of #X_0# the King and #X_0# at Colonus. #X_0# becomes king of Thebes before the action of #X_0# the King begins. He is renowned for his intelligence and his ability to solve riddles—he saved the city of Thebes and was made its king by solving the riddle of the Sphinx, the supernatural being that had held the city captive. Yet #X_0# is stubbornly blind to the truth about himself. His name’s literal meaning (“swollen foot”) is the clue to his identity—he was taken from the house of Laius as a baby and left in the mountains with his feet bound together. On his way to Thebes, he killed his biological father, not knowing who he was, and proceeded to marry #X_1#, his biological mother.

-- #X_0# --
Oedipus’s wife and mother, and Creon’s sister. #X_0# appears only in the final scenes of Oedipus the King. In her first words, she attempts to make peace between Oedipus and Creon, pleading with Oedipus not to banish Creon. She is comforting to her husband and calmly tries to urge him to reject Tiresias’s terrifying prophecies as false. #X_0# solves the riddle of Oedipus’s identity before Oedipus does, and she expresses her love for her son and husband in her desire to protect him from this knowledge.

-- #X_0# --
Child of Oedipus and Jocasta, and therefore both Oedipus’s daughter and his sister. #X_0# appears briefly at the end of Oedipus the King, when she says goodbye to her father as Creon prepares to banish Oedipus. She appears at greater length in Oedipus at Colonus, leading and caring for her old, blind father in his exile. But #X_0# comes into her own in #X_0#. As that play’s protagonist, she demonstrates a courage and clarity of sight unparalleled by any other character in the three #X_1# plays. Whereas other characters—Oedipus, Creon, Polynices—are reluctant to acknowledge the consequences of their actions, #X_0# is unabashed in her conviction that she has done right.

-- #X_0# --
Oedipus’s brother-in-law, #X_0# appears more than any other character in the three plays combined. In him more than anyone else we see the gradual rise and fall of one man’s power. Early in Oedipus the King, #X_0# claims to have no desire for kingship. Yet, when he has the opportunity to grasp power at the end of that play, #X_0# seems quite eager. We learn in Oedipus at Colonus that he is willing to fight with his nephews for this power, and in Antigone #X_0# rules Thebes with a stubborn blindness that is similar to Oedipus’s rule. But #X_0# never has our sympathy in the way Oedipus does, because he is bossy and bureaucratic, intent on asserting his own authority.

-- #X_0# --
Son of Oedipus, and thus also his brother. #X_0# appears only very briefly in Oedipus at Colonus. He arrives at Colonus seeking his father’s blessing in his battle with his brother, Eteocles, for power in Thebes. #X_0# tries to point out the similarity between his own situation and that of Oedipus, but his words seem opportunistic rather than filial, a fact that Oedipus points out.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, the blind soothsayer of Thebes, appears in both Oedipus the King and Antigone. In Oedipus the King, #X_0# tells Oedipus that he is the murderer he hunts, and Oedipus does not believe him. In Antigone, #X_0# tells Creon that Creon himself is bringing disaster upon Thebes, and Creon does not believe him. Yet, both Oedipus and Creon claim to trust #X_0# deeply. The literal blindness of the soothsayer points to the metaphorical blindness of those who refuse to believe the truth about themselves when they hear it spoken.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s son, who appears only in #X_1#. #X_0# is engaged to marry #X_1#. Motivated by his love for her, he argues with #X_2# about the latter’s decision to punish her.

-- #X_0# --
Oedipus’s daughter #X_0# appears at the end of Oedipus the King and to a limited extent in Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone. #X_0#’s minor part underscores her sister’s grandeur and courage. #X_0# fears helping Antigone bury Polynices but offers to die beside Antigone when Creon sentences her to die. Antigone, however, refuses to allow her sister to be martyred for something she did not have the courage to stand up for.

-- #X_0# --
The king of Athens in Oedipus at Colonus. A renowned and powerful warrior, #X_0# takes pity on Oedipus and defends him against Creon. #X_0# is the only one who knows the spot at which Oedipus descended to the underworld—a secret he promises Oedipus he will hold forever.

-- #X_0# --
Sometimes comically obtuse or fickle, sometimes perceptive, sometimes melodramatic, the #X_0# reacts to the events onstage. The #X_0#’s reactions can be lessons in how the audience should interpret what it is seeing, or how it should not interpret what it is seeing.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s wife.

-- #X_0# --
The play's tragic heroine. In the first moments of the play, #X_0# is opposed to her radiant sister #X_1#. Unlike her beautiful and docile sister, #X_0# is sallow, withdrawn, and recalcitrant.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s uncle. #X_0#is powerfully built, but a weary and wrinkled man suffering the burdens of rule. A practical man, he firmly distances himself from the tragic aspirations of Oedipus and his line. As he tells #X_1#, his only interest is in political and social order. #X_0#is bound to ideas of good sense, simplicity, and the banal happiness of everyday life.

-- #X_0# --
Blonde, full-figured, and radiantly beautiful, the laughing, talkative #X_0# is the good girl of the family. She is reasonable and understands her place, bowing to #X_2#'s edict and attempting to dissuade #X_1# from her act of rebellion. As in #X_3#' play, she is #X_1#'s foil. Ultimately she will recant and beg #X_1# to allow her to join her in death. Though #X_1# refuses, #X_0#'s conversion indicates how her resistance is contagious.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s young fiancé and son to #X_2#. #X_0# appears twice in the play. In the first, he is rejected by #X_1#; in the second, he begs his father for #X_1#'s life. #X_2#'s refusal ruins his exalted view of his father. He too refuses the happiness that #X_2# offers him and follows #X_1# to a tragic demise.

-- #X_0# --
A traditional figure in Greek drama, the #X_0# is an addition to the #X_1# legend. She introduces an everyday, maternal element into the play that heightens the strangeness of the tragic world. Fussy, affectionate, and reassuring, she suffers no drama or tragedy but exists in the day-to-day tasks of caring for the two sisters. Her comforting presence returns #X_1# to her girlhood. In her arms, #X_1# superstitiously invests the #X_0# with the power to ward off evil and keep her safe.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# reduces the #X_0#, who appears as narrator and commentator. The #X_0# frames the play with a prologue and epilogue, introducing the action and characters under the sign of fatality. In presenting the tragedy, the #X_0# instructs the audience on proper spectatorship, reappearing at the tragedy's pivotal moments to comment on the action or the nature of tragedy itself. Along with playing narrator, the #X_0# also attempts to intercede throughout the play, whether on the behalf of the Theban people or the horrified spectators.

-- #X_0# --
The three Guardsmen are interpolations into the #X_2# legend, doubles for the rank-and-file fascist collaborators or collabos of #X_1#'s day. The card-playing trio, made all the more mindless and indistinguishable in being grouped in three, emerges from a long stage tradition of the dull-witted police officer. They are eternally indifferent, innocent, and ready to serve..

-- #X_0# --
Largely indistinguishable from his cohorts, the #X_0#jeeringly compares #X_1# to an exhibitionist upon her arrest.

-- #X_0# --
The last of the indifferent #X_0#smen, he is also largely indistinguishable from his cohorts.

-- #X_0# --
Another typical figure of Greek drama who also appears in #X_2#' Antigone, the #X_0# is a pale and solitary boy who bears the news of death. In the prologue, he casts a menacing shadow: as the Chorus notes, he remains apart from the others in his premonition of #X_1#'s death.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s attendant. The #X_0# is a figure of young innocence. He sees all, understands nothing, and is no help to anyone but one day may become either a #X_2# or an #X_1# in his own right.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s kind, knitting wife whose only function, as the Chorus declares, is to knit in her room until it is her time to die. Her suicide is #X_1#'s last punishment, leaving him entirely alone.

-- #X_0# --
A once fierce and feared soldier who rules #Y_1# along with #X_2# and Lepidus. When the play opens, #X_0# has neglected his duties as a ruler in order to live in #Y_0#, where he carries on a highly visible love affair with #X_1#. His loyalty is divided between the Western and Eastern worlds; he is torn between the sense of duty and the desire to seek pleasure, between reason and passion. While he feels the need to reaffirm the honor that has made him a celebrated Roman hero, he is also madly in love with #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The queen of #Y_0# and #X_1#’s lover. A highly attractive woman who once seduced #X_2#, #X_0# delights in the thought that she has caught #X_1# like a fish. In matters of love, as in all things, #X_0# favors high drama: her emotions are as volatile as they are theatrical, and, regardless of whether her audience is her handmaid or the emperor of #Y_1#, she always offers a top-notch performance. Although she tends to make a spectacle of her emotions, one cannot doubt the genuine nature of her love for #X_1#. #X_3# makes clear that the queen does love the general, even if her loyalty is sometimes misplaced.

-- #X_0# --
The nephew and adopted son of Julius #X_0#. #X_0# rules the Roman Empire with #X_1# and Lepidus. Relations between #X_0# and #X_1# are strained throughout the play, for the young triumvir believes that #X_1# squanders his time and neglects his duties while in Egypt. Ambitious and extremely pragmatic, #X_0# lacks #X_1#’s military might as a general, but his careful and stoic reasoning enables him to avoid #X_1#’s tendency toward heroic or romantic folly. Destined to be the first Roman emperor (later renamed #X_0# Augustus), he symbolizes “Western” values in the play, which stand opposed to the exotic lures of #X_3#’s “East.”

-- #X_0# --
Antony’s most loyal supporter. Worldly and cynical, #X_0# is friendly with the subordinates of both #X_2# and #X_1#, yet stays faithful to his master even after Antony makes grave political and military missteps. He abandons Antony only when the general appears to be completely finished.

-- #X_0# --
The third member of the triumvirate and the weakest, both politically and personally. #X_0#’s rather desperate attempts to keep the peace between #X_2# and #X_1# fail when #X_2# imprisons him after the defeat of #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The son of a great general who was one of Julius #X_3#’s partners in power. #X_0# is young and popular with the Roman people, and he possesses enough military might to stand as a legitimate threat to the triumvirs. He fancies himself honorable for refusing to allow one of his men to kill the unsuspecting #X_3#, #X_2#, and #X_5# when they are his guests.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# sister. #X_0# marries Antony in order to cement an alliance between the two triumvirs. She is a victim of Antony’s deception, and her meekness, purity, and submission make her the paradigm of Roman womanhood, and #X_1#’s polar opposite.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s faithful attendants.

-- #X_0# --
An Egyptian fortune-teller who follows Antony to Rome and predicts that his fortune will always pale in comparison to Caesar’s.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_3# men. #X_0# is assigned to guard the captive #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_2# officers. #X_0# leads the retreat from Antony’s unexpectedly powerful forces.

-- #X_0# --
A general in Antony’s army. After the battle in which Antony follows Cleopatra’s lead and flees, #X_0# surrenders and defects to Caesar’s side.

-- #X_0# --
A Roman soldier under Antony’s command. #X_0# leads the legions to victory against the kingdom of Parthia. Although a competent fighter, he cautiously decides not to push his troops further into battle, for fear that winning too much glory would sour his relationship with Antony.

-- #X_0# --
A brave young soldier serving under Antony. #X_0# garners fantastic wounds in the battle against Caesar’s army, and begs for the opportunity to win more.

-- #X_0# --
One of Caesar’s soldiers, who proves untrustworthy.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s servant. She employs #X_0# to bring to Antony the message that she has not committed suicide but is still alive.

-- #X_0# --
An attendant serving Antony. #X_0#’s love for his master compels him to refuse Antony’s order that #X_0# kill him.

-- #X_0# --
An ambitious young soldier under #X_4#. During the dinner party that #X_4# hosts for the triumvirate, #X_0# asks for permission to kill #X_2#, #X_1#, and #X_3#, which would result in the control of the world falling into his master’s hands.

-- #X_0# --
Cleopatra’s treasurer, who betrays his master.

-- #X_0# --
An Egyptian who brings a basket of figs containing poisonous snakes to Cleopatra.

-- #X_0# --
One of Antony’s soldiers.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the young, impetuous genius child of #X_2# and Lady #X_1# aged thirteen and later sixteen. #X_0# miraculously theorizes the second law of thermodynamics and understands chaos theory way ahead of her time.

-- #X_0# --
Academic and tutor of #X_2# Coverly, #X_0# works on his own research while teaching #X_2#. #X_0# falls in love with #X_2# and, after her death, spends his time researching and attempting to prove her theories.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the distinguished, middle-aged butler of #Y_0# who delivers many letters.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is a poet and amateur biologist-neither of which he does particularly well. Mr. #X_0#'s wife is constantly cheating on him and has made her rounds between almost all of the men at the estate. Mr. #X_0# dies in #Y_0# of a spider bite.

-- #X_0# --
Mr. #X_0# is the gardener who excels at frustrating Lady #X_1# with his new garden plans, spying on carnal embrace, drawing beautiful pictures of the estate and building an improved steam engine. #X_0# has drawn up plans to transform #Y_0# into a classical masterpiece.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the bossy, battle-ax who storms around the estate. There exists two #X_0#'s in Arcadia; however, we only meet one—the #X_0# of the early nineteenth century. #X_0# is perceptive of all things and knows all happening on the property.

-- #X_0# --
Captain #X_0# is the sea captain, apparently in love with Mrs. #X_1#. #X_0# takes Mr. and Mrs. #X_1# on his sea voyage to #Y_0#, where Mr. #X_1# perishes.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the champion of academic knowledge in Arcadia. While her discoveries are less important than young #X_1#'s, #X_0# has all but rejected any notion of romantic knowledge in favor of intellectual work. #X_0# is an author working on the hermit of #Y_0# and is in her late thirties.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_1#'s modern day equivalent. #X_0#, aged eighteen, seems as perceptive as #X_1#, but lacks the education to have #X_1#'s brilliance. #X_0# argues that a Newtonian universe would be destroyed by the random nature of sexual acts.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the modern fool and fop. In his late thirties, #X_0# leaps over truth in favor of finding fame for his theory that Lord #X_1# killed #X_2#. The theory, eventually proved false by #X_3#, brings #X_0# great shame and embarrassment.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, aged twenty-five to thirty, is still supposedly a graduate student studying mathematics. The son of the #X_0# estate, #X_0# works out #X_2#'s diagram and reluctantly shares #X_2#'s genius with #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the self-elected mute son of #X_5#. #X_0# is a connector and communicator between past and present; #X_0# intuitively knows where the foundation for the ruined outbuilding is. He dresses #X_1# in #Y_0# clothing and gives #X_3# the trans-generational apple that #X_4# eats. #X_0# is also present in the historical story—the actor is double cast as #X_1# #X_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, aged fifteen, is double cast with Gus #X_0#. #X_0# only appears in one scene as #X_3#'s unruly young brother who wants #X_2# to tell him about sex.

-- #X_0# --
The play’s protagonist and heroine. #X_0# is a young woman living in the provinces in #Y_0#, and born into the wealthy #X_2# family. She pines for her fiancé #X_3#, who has just led a successful, if ill-planned, cavalry charge against the Serbs. #X_0# meets and falls in love with #X_1#, the Swiss “chocolate cream soldier” fighting for the Serbs.

-- #X_0# --
Swiss mercenary fighting for the Serbs, and #X_3#’s love interest, who she calls “the chocolate cream soldier.” He is skilled in warfare and emotionally sophisticated, but has a weakness for sweets. #X_0#hides in #X_3#’s room with her help. When he returns in the spring to return Major #X_2#’s cloak, events are set into motion that bring out #X_1# and #X_3#’s conspiracy to help him, and that lead to his engagement to #X_3# and an ultimately happy ending.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s fiancé, and the hero of the Battle of Slivnitza. #X_0#, by his own and many others’ admission, has no military skill. He led the charge out of a mixture of foolhardiness and desire for self-aggrandizement. #X_0# flirts with the #X_2#’ servant #X_1#, and the play ends in their engagement.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#’s mother, and matriarch of the #X_2# household. #X_0# wants to marry off her daughter to as wealthy and prominent a man as possible. When #X_5# appears to be this man, #X_0# approves of the union. As it becomes clear that #X_5# is not the man he presented himself to be, #X_0# is willing to switch her allegiances to #X_1#. #X_0# is focused on making sure the #X_2#s’ are up-to-date in their home furnishings and technology.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_2#’ female servant. #X_0#is engaged to #X_1#, the head male servant. She has a vexed if flirtatious relationship with #X_4#, who engaged to #X_3#. #X_0#wants to better her social station by marrying a noble, and criticizes #X_1# for having no aspirations over those of a common servant.

-- #X_0# --
Head of the #X_0# family, and #X_4#’s father. The #X_0# is a decent if unambitious soldier, and he seems concerned mostly with maintaining his family’s social position in the rural parts of #Y_0#. He and #X_3# are willing to accept #X_2# as #X_4#’s suitor by the play’s end only after he demonstrates just how wealthy he is.

-- #X_0# --
Head male servant of the #X_2# estate. #X_0# initially reprimands #X_1# for her willingness to leverage information she’s heard as gossip against the #X_2#s. #X_1# feels that #X_0# is not ambitious enough because he is content to be a servant for the rest of his life. #X_0# ends the play by breaking his engagement amicably with #X_1#, allowing her to be engaged to #X_4#.

-- #X_0# --
A soldier for the Serbian side, who knows #X_1#. This unnamed #X_0# meets #X_3# and #X_5# during an exchange of goods. He tells them a story about his #X_0# who hid in a Bulgarian home and escaped with the help of two Bulgarian women. #X_3# and #X_5# have no idea this soldier’s story is about #X_1#, #X_4#, and #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The novel's title character and protagonist, #X_0# is a curious young man whose life in the medical profession makes up the plot of the book. He is stubborn and inclined toward laboratory science, rather than the practice of being a physician. He has opposing characteristics and can be both cold and compassionate, both driven and easily swayed. Furthermore, he is a romantic at heart.

-- #X_0# --
A country doctor in #Y_0#, Doc #X_0# was #X_2#'s first introduction to the world of medicine. The doctor is not an all-together educated man although he is supportive of #X_2#. And, although Doc #X_0# is an alcoholic, he is not altogether unlikable.

-- #X_0# --
A German Jew, #X_0#is #X_1#'s mentor. He is a scientist rather than a physician. He is often seen as eccentric and as cold or lacking in compassion although he does have a deep belief in #X_1#. A patient man, he is utterly driven by a search for "truth" and is fully committed to the study of science.

-- #X_0# --
A graduate student at #Y_0#, #X_0#attends the same college as #X_2#. She eventually becomes his fiancé, but is what #X_2# calls an "improver." She is a snobbish student of literature who tries to change people, including #X_2#, to fit her beliefs and her society.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_2#'s fellow medics, #X_0#tries his hardest to learn and yet he does not have the brightest mind at #Y_1#. In fact, #X_0# is the archetypal nice, yet dumb, guy at the #Y_0#. He eventually becomes an obstetrician.

-- #X_0# --
A classmate of #X_2#'s, #X_0#is a preacher who tries to impose his religious beliefs on others. His path crosses #X_2#'s more than once and he eventually betrays #X_2#. He believes he is doing "good" but is arrogant in his beliefs—most of which are narrow-minded, superior-minded, and colonial.

-- #X_0# --
A good student and successful surgeon, #X_0#was #X_2#'s rival at medical school. He is a hard worker and always achieves that for which he strives. He believes in success and is the opposite of #X_2# in many ways.

-- #X_0# --
The class jester, #X_0# #X_0#, resigns from medical school and becomes a car salesman. He is unorthodox in his business and, in the end, too different from #X_2# to remain his friend.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s loyal wife, #X_0# is opinionated and yet completely supportive and understanding of #X_1# and his career. She is caring and although ambitionless herself, she is loving and a perfect fit for #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The compassionate physician, #X_0#is supportive of #X_2# and epitomizes the "good doctor." He is caring and believes more in the practice of medicine than in research.

-- #X_0# --
The director of #Y_1# and later a leading member of the League of Cultural #X_0#gencies, #X_0# stands for everything that #X_2# opposes. He believes wholeheartedly in competition and, not in the individual, but in "cooperation." He is one of the many "salesmen" in the medical industry that exist in the novel. He is criticized by #X_2# for not being as intelligent as someone in his position should be.

-- #X_0# --
Neither a laboratory man nor a physician exactly, #X_0# is a one-man army against disease. A captivating speaker, he is compulsive and adventuresome, and yet, often compassionate.

-- #X_0# --
The subject of a great deal of #X_1#'s satire, #X_0# is the Director of #Y_1# in the small city of #Y_0#. He campaigns for cleanliness and writes bad poetry about Health and sanitation for his daughters (whom he has named the "Healthette Octette") to sing. He is a great salesman and commercialist.

-- #X_0# --
The oldest daughter of Almus #X_0#, #X_0# is a young, flirtatious, and beautiful girl who #X_2# becomes enamored of #X_2# and admires his eccentricities and intelligence.

-- #X_0# --
A department head at #Y_0#, #X_0# has very much the same business mind-set as #X_3#. He believes in competition and success and eventually joins #Y_1# with #X_3#. He constantly brags about an old war wound and becomes another foil for #X_2#'s personality.

-- #X_0# --
The secretary to Dr. #X_1# at the institute, Miss #X_0#is a beautiful woman who joins the men in competition. From being #X_4#'s assistant, she has learned the "business" and even attempts to attain the directorship when #X_4# resigns. When #X_2# is head of the institute, she basically runs it because of #X_2#'s lack of attention in commercial matters.

-- #X_0# --
A laboratory scientist much like #X_1#, #X_0#is completely committed to his work. He does not have a family or much of a social life because of this commitment. He is the extreme of what #X_2# could be, and by the end of the novel he becomes the symbol of freedom and independence. He is very much an individual in a world of "collaborators" and he strives always for what he believes. He is stubborn and thought of as cold, though he and #X_2# have an "understanding" of each other and are, in fact comrades by the end.

-- #X_0# --
The second wife of #X_1# Arrowsmith, #X_0# is a rich woman with whom #X_1# does not have very much in common. She is a high class "arranger" and a widow who spends her time frivolously and goes to Africa to "save primitive art."

-- #X_0# --
The wife of Anse #X_0# and mother to #X_2#, #X_3#, #X_6#, #X_4#, and #X_7#. #X_0# is a mostly absent protagonist, and her death triggers the novel’s action. She is a former schoolteacher whose bitter, loveless life causes her to despise her husband and to invest all of her love in her favorite child, #X_6#, rather than in the rest of her family or #X_5#.

-- #X_0# --
The head of the #X_0# family. #X_0# is a poor farmer afflicted with a hunchback, whose instincts are overwhelmingly selfish. His poor childrearing skills seem to be largely responsible for his children’s various predicaments. Alternately hated and disrespected by his children, #X_0# nonetheless succeeds in achieving his two greatest goals in one fell swoop: burying his dead wife in her hometown of #Y_0#, and acquiring a new set of false teeth.

-- #X_0# --
The second #X_0# child. #X_0# is the most sensitive and articulate of the surviving #X_0#s and delivers the greatest number of interior monologues in the novel. As the family encounters disaster upon disaster during the trip, #X_0#’s frustration with the whole process leads him to try to end things decisively by incinerating his dead mother’s coffin.

-- #X_0# --
The bastard child of #X_1# and #X_3#, the minister. Though #X_2# seems to understand him, #X_0# remains the novel’s greatest mystery, and is the least represented in its many sections. #X_0# has a proud, fiercely independent nature that most of his family and neighbors confuse for selfishness. His passionate, brooding nature, however, reveals a real love and dedication to his mother, and he becomes a fierce protector of her coffin.

-- #X_0# --
The eldest #X_0# child and a skilled carpenter. #X_0# is the paragon of patience and selflessness, almost to the point of absurdity. He refuses ever to complain about his broken, festering leg, allowing the injury to degenerate to the point that he may never walk again. #X_0# emerges as one of the novel’s few consistently stable characters.

-- #X_0# --
The only #X_0# daughter. #X_0# #X_0# is seventeen, and a recent sexual experience has left her pregnant. Increasingly desperate, she finds her mind occupied exclusively with her pregnancy, and views all men with varying degrees of suspicion.

-- #X_0# --
The youngest of the #X_0# children. #X_0# has a lively imagination, and he views his mother’s death through the same lens with which he views a fish he has recently caught and cleaned. Although his ramblings at the beginning of the novel border on the maniacal, #X_0# proves to be a thoughtful and innocent child.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_2#’ wealthier neighbor. #X_0# is both a critic of and an unappreciated help to the #X_2#. He hires #X_5#, #X_6#, and #X_3# for odd jobs, and helps the family cross the river in spite of its overt hostility toward him. #X_0# and his wife #X_4#, however, are critical of the #X_2#’ decision to bury #X_1#’s body in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
Vernon #X_0#’s wife. #X_0# stays with #X_1# during #X_1#’s final hours. A deeply religious woman and pious to a fault, #X_0# frequently and vocally disapproves of #X_1#’s impiety and behavior.

-- #X_0# --
The father of #X_2#’s child. While he never appears in person in the novel, #X_0# is certainly a driving force behind many of #X_2#’s thoughts and much of her behavior. In a supreme effort to disassociate himself from her problems, #X_0# gives #X_2# ten dollars with which to pay for  an abortion.

-- #X_0# --
The local minister. Held up by #X_3# as the pinnacle of piety, #X_0# is in fact a hypocrite. His affair with #X_1# results in #X_4#’s conception, and, though #X_0# resolves to confess the affair to #X_2#, he ends up deciding that the mere intention to confess will do just as well.

-- #X_0# --
The severely overweight rural doctor who attends to #X_2# and later to #X_4#. #X_0# is extremely critical of the way #X_3# treats his children.

-- #X_0# --
The local farmer who puts up the #X_3# on the first evening of their disastrous funeral journey. #X_0# sees the #X_3#’ problems as a judgment on the family’s uncouth manners and on #X_1# and #X_2#’s disregard for God and their own children.

-- #X_0# --
A local farmer who puts up the #X_3# on the  second evening of their funeral journey. #X_2# repeatedly and rigidly refuses #X_0#’s offer to lend #X_2# a team of mules.

-- #X_0# --
A farmer who puts up the #X_2# later in their journey.

-- #X_0# --
The #Y_0# druggist who indignantly refuses #X_1#’s request for an abortion. #X_0#’s stern lecture to #X_1# is both the embodiment of sanctimoniousness and, some might say, of  fatherly caring.

-- #X_0# --
A rather despicable young employee at a #Y_1# drugstore. #X_0# extorts a sexual favor from #Y_0# in return for a fake abortion treatment.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s son, who helps #X_1# save the animals from the burning barn.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the novel. #X_0#runs the grocery that is central to the novel and is the character who represents the heart of the novel. #X_0# is an honest, thoughtful compassionate man who serves other people even though the world constantly delivers bad luck to him. His character is held up as the model of morality and it is what #X_1# attempts to emulate. In a community characterized by social and economic troubles, #X_0# stands as a bedrock of moral support. His store provides the milk and bread that nourishes the community, just as his ethics help to treat all people in a humane manner.

-- #X_0# --
The wife of #X_5# #X_0# and the mother of #X_3# #X_0#. #X_0# is a slightly worrisome older Jewish woman, but she is a good person who appears to have a good soul. #X_0# worries most about #X_1# Alpine, a gentile, becoming involved with her daughter. Her bias toward her ethnicity is such that she weeps upon finding out that #X_3# actually kissed #X_1#. Still, although #X_0# views #X_1# suspiciously throughout the novel, she is not unkind to him. Like #X_5#, she does not consider #X_1# a bad man for taking milk and bread because he was starving. Additionally, although she would like him to leave, she also pays him more money because she feels that it is only fair given their increased profits. While #X_3# worries, she has a gentle character that is without malice. Her constant Yiddish style of debating and arguing with her husband provides a light comic touch to the novel.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of #X_2# and Morris #X_0#. #X_0# bears a classical name and in many ways appears to be a classical character. She lacks the Yiddish dialect of her parents and speaks in educated English. She longs to read and become a great scholar and learn the classics, but her limited access to college makes her very frustrated. For this reason, #X_0# becomes a dreamer who does not always perceive people and situations correctly. For example, she initially fails to perceive that #X_4# is not seriously interested in her, which later crushes her after she has sex with him. Next, she places her own perceptions of #X_1# upon him, thereby not entirely reading his character correctly. #X_0# undergoes a character development of her own that mirrors #X_1#'s in some ways, making her a more realized creature at the end of the novel.

-- #X_0# --
The stranger who appears in the #X_1#' neighborhood and eventually takes over their grocery. #X_0# #X_0#'s struggle to control his self and his character is the driving conflict of the novel. #X_0# is torn between his tendency to do bad and his desire to do good. He idolizes #X_4# as a model of good, yet even while he fantasizes of being like the Saint he continues to steal from the grocery. #X_0# initially appears to be the assistant to #X_3#'s techniques of running the grocery, but in truth becomes an assistant to his way of life. By the end of the novel, #X_0# will have fully come to embrace #X_3#'s ethical system.

-- #X_0# --
The liquor storeowner down the street from the #X_1#. #X_0#is a Yiddish- speaking immigrant to #Y_1# like #X_4# Bober, but #X_0# is a far less compassionate character. Financial considerations almost always influence #X_0#'s actions. #X_0# leases the tailor shop to a grocer, even though he realizes that the move will possibly ruin #X_4# Bober's business. #X_0# wants his son to marry #X_2#, but only does so because he wants to expand his economic empire to include #X_4#'s store. #X_0# is the most prosperous merchant on the block, but he is too cheap to buy a telephone and always uses #X_4#. #X_0# likes to be around #X_4# and likes #X_4# to like him, but #X_0# has little moral conscience of his own. #X_0# is an immigrant who managed to have initial success in #Y_0#, but who does nothing to support his fellow immigrants around him.

-- #X_0# --
The lazy son of Julius #X_0#. #X_0# never has achieved anything on his own and makes his living running his father's store. #X_0# has no ambition for anything greater in life. Even as an employee in his father's store, #X_0# steals from his father. When Julius #X_0# has a heart attack at the end of the novel, #X_0# decides that the liquor store will be closed because he is too lazy to take care of it while his father recovers. #X_0#'s actions stand in sharp contrast to those of #X_1#, who effectively is the foster son of #X_3# and who works diligently to keep the store running.

-- #X_0# --
The son of Detective #X_0# and the true bad person in the novel. In the pairing of sons and fathers, #X_0#represents the wicked son. Although his father is a detective, #X_0#has long violated the law. His father takes #X_0#'s failings as a son and a human seriously, beating him, and ejecting him from his household. Although the seriousness of #X_0#'s father might seem slightly harsh and although #X_0# is a character who suffers, mostly from Diabetes toward the end of the book, he is not a very sympathetic person. He is racist and cruel. He tries to violently rape #X_1# and he hits #X_2# out of spite and complete malice. #X_0#is an evildoer, with no redeeming qualities.

-- #X_0# --
The father of Ward #X_0# and the detective who investigates the crimes on the #X_2#' block. #X_0#is portrayed as a sympathetic character, who treats the #X_2# kindly and genuinely tries to help them with no discrimination. #X_0#is a strict father, but his desire to maintain the law seems appropriate. Although #X_0#beats his son after his son robs #X_3#'s liquor store, if he did not, his son would be put in jail. #X_0# #X_0#'s troubled relationship with his son testifies to the theme of father-son relationships that #X_4# explores in the novel.

-- #X_0# --
Represents the most socially and educationally successful son in the novel. #X_0#has managed to become a college graduate and a law student as a first generation American, something that none of the other immigrant children have done. Despite his achievements, #X_0# is not a kind and compassionate man. Although he will study the law, he treats #X_1# without true fairness by using her for sexual favors, although he will not marry her due to her poverty. #X_0#, like #X_2#, is another person who acts out of self-interest with little care and attention to the needs of others.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#'s sister and #X_5# and Goldie #X_0#'s daughter. #X_0# is a minor character who serves as #X_3#'s one friend. Compared to #X_3#, #X_0# is unintelligent and uninteresting, but there is no evidence that she is unkind.

-- #X_0# --
The seller of paper bags who frequently visits the #X_3#' grocery store. #X_0#represents life and the unwillingness to suffer and yield in the face of difficult circumstances. #X_0#though he has a terminal form of cancer, he keeps working diligently as a paper bag salesman, not willing to simply give up and die. Because of his attitude, he is able to live much longer than the doctors believe that he shall. #X_4# thinks that #X_0# represents suffering, but actually #X_0# represents the desire for life and living that people in difficult circumstances manages to embody.

-- #X_0# --
The seller of light bulbs. #X_0# rarely speaks in the book, but he too is a man who persists in the face of difficult times. Although #X_0#'s partner defrauded him and ran away with his wife, #X_0# goes on. He does not seem happy and he suffers, but his life continues. Through his struggle, he embodies the possibilities of life. His sale of light bulbs carries a metaphorical connotation in that he is giving people the instruments that will light up their lives, symbolically suggesting the possibility that he is giving them the tools that will allow them to illuminate themselves.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# and #X_1#'s parents who own the candy store on the block. They are relatively successful and #X_0# manages to make money betting on the horses. Little is known about them, but they help demonstrate the ways that immigrants in #Y_0# have struggled.

-- #X_0# --
They rent the upstairs apartment from #X_2#. Little is known about them. #X_0# and #X_0# are Italian and poor immigrants. Their presence helps to show the diversity of the neighborhood and the way that people of all different ethnic backgrounds struggle in the city after they first arrive.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# and #X_2#'s deceased son. #X_0# died of an ear infection at an age that is not specified. Little is known about #X_0#'s personality, but his death has created a void in #X_3# Bober's life that creates much of his sadness. The fact that #X_3# Bober has been left without a son is important in the plot, however, because #X_1# is able to fill the space that #X_0# one held and become a foster child.

-- #X_0# --
German owner of the grocery store across the street. #X_0# never acts in the novel, but is a subtle presence because the presence of his store negatively affects the #X_1#' store. #X_0#'s German ethnicity is noteworthy because of the persecuting role that German's played on the Jews during the Holocaust. On an allegorical level, the way that #X_0# pushes #X_2# out of business and into deeper poverty can be compared to the way that Germans made Jews suffer in Europe.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of Duke Senior. #X_0#, considered one of #X_3#’s most delightful heroines, is independent minded, strong-willed, good-hearted, and terribly clever. Rather than slink off into defeated exile, #X_0# resourcefully uses her trip to the Forest of #Y_0# as an opportunity to take control of her own destiny. When she disguises herself as #X_1#—a handsome young man—and offers herself as a tutor in the ways of love to her beloved #X_2#, #X_0#’s talents and charms are on full display. Only #X_0#, for instance, is both aware of the foolishness of romantic love and delighted to be in love. She teaches those around her to think, feel, and love better than they have previously, and she ensures that the courtiers returning from #Y_0# are far gentler than those who fled to it.

-- #X_0# --
The youngest son of Sir #X_6# and younger brother of #X_4#. #X_0# is an attractive young man who, under his brother’s neglectful care, has languished without a gentleman’s education or training. Regardless, he considers himself to have great potential, and his victorious battle with #X_3# proves him right. #X_0# cares for the aging #X_2# in #Y_0# and later risks his life to save #X_4# from a hungry lioness, proving himself a proper gentleman. He is a fitting hero for the play and, though he proves no match for her wit or poetry, the most obvious romantic match for #X_5#.

-- #X_0# --
The father of #X_4# and the rightful ruler of the dukedom in which the play is set. Having been banished by his usurping brother, #X_2#, #X_0# now lives in exile in the Forest of Ardenne with a number of loyal men, including Lord #X_1# and #X_3#. We have the sense that #X_0# did not put up much of a fight to keep his dukedom, for he seems to make the most of whatever life gives him. Content in the forest, where he claims to learn as much from stones and brooks as he would in a church or library, #X_0# proves himself to be a kind and fair-minded ruler.

-- #X_0# --
A faithful lord who accompanies #X_1# into exile in the Forest of Ardenne. #X_0# is an example of a stock figure in Elizabethan comedy, the man possessed of a hopelessly melancholy disposition. Much like a referee in a football game, he stands on the sidelines, watching and judging the actions of the other characters without ever fully participating. Given his inability to participate in life, it is fitting that #X_0# alone refuses to follow #X_1# and the other courtiers back to court, and instead resolves to assume a solitary and contemplative life in a monastery.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of Duke #X_2# and #X_4#’s dearest friend. #X_0#’s devotion to #X_4# is unmatched, as evidenced by her decision to follow her cousin into exile. To make the trip, #X_0# assumes the disguise of a simple shepherdess and calls herself #X_1#. As elucidated by her extreme love of #X_4# and her immediate devotion to #X_3#, whom she marries at the end of the play, #X_0# possesses a loving heart, but is prone to deep, almost excessive emotions.

-- #X_0# --
The brother of #X_0# Senior and usurper of his throne. #X_0#’s cruel nature and volatile temper are displayed when he banishes his niece, #X_2#, from court without reason. That #X_1#, his own daughter, cannot mitigate his unfounded anger demonstrates the intensity of the duke’s hatefulness. #X_0# mounts an army against his exiled brother but aborts his vengeful mission after he meets an old religious man on the road to the Forest of Ardenne. He immediately changes his ways, dedicating himself to a monastic life and returning the crown to his brother, thus testifying to the ease and elegance with which humans can sometimes change for the better.

-- #X_0# --
A clown in Duke Frederick’s court who accompanies #X_2# and #X_1# in their flight to #Y_0#. Although #X_0#’s job, as fool, is to criticize the behavior and point out the folly of those around him, #X_0# fails to do so with even a fraction of #X_2#’s grace. Next to his mistress, the clown seems hopelessly vulgar and narrow-minded. Almost every line he speaks echoes with bawdy innuendo.

-- #X_0# --
The oldest son of Sir #X_4# and sole inheritor of the #X_5# estate. #X_0# is a loveless young man who begrudges his brother, #X_3#, a gentleman’s education. He admits to hating #X_3# without cause or reason and goes to great lengths to ensure his brother’s downfall. When Duke #X_2# employs #X_0# to find his missing brother, #X_0# finds himself living in despair in the Forest of Ardenne, where #X_3# saves his life. This display of undeserved generosity prompts #X_0# to change himself into a better, more loving person. His transformation is evidenced by his love for the disguised #X_1#, whom he takes to be a simple shepherdess.

-- #X_0# --
A young, suffering shepherd, who is desperately in love with the disdainful Phoebe. Conforming to the model of Petrarchan love, #X_0# prostrates himself before a woman who refuses to return his affections. In the end, however, he wins the object of his desire.

-- #X_0# --
A young shepherdess, who disdains the affections of Silvius. She falls in love with Ganymede, who is really Rosalind in disguise, but Rosalind tricks #X_0# into marrying Silvius.

-- #X_0# --
A faithful lord who accompanies #X_2# into exile in the Forest of Ardenne. #X_0# is rather jolly and loves to sing.

-- #X_0# --
A professional wrestler in Duke Frederick’s court. #X_0# demonstrates both his caring nature and his political savvy when he asks #X_1# to intercede in his upcoming fight with #X_2#: he does not want to injure the young man and thereby lose favor among the nobles who support him. #X_0#’s concern for #X_2# proves unwarranted when #X_2# beats him senseless.

-- #X_0# --
The elderly former servant of Sir #X_2#. Having witnessed #X_1#’s hardships, #X_0# offers not only to accompany his young master into exile but to fund their journey with the whole of his modest life’s savings. He is a model of loyalty and devoted service.

-- #X_0# --
The father of #X_2# and #X_3#, friend of Duke Senior, and enemy of Duke Fre#X_0#rick. Upon #X_0# #X_0#’s #X_0#ath, the vast majority of his estate was han#X_0#d over to #X_2# according to the custom of primogeniture.

-- #X_0# --
A shepherd. #X_0# attempts to counsel his friend Silvius in the ways of love, but Silvius refuses to listen.

-- #X_0# --
A simpleminded goatherd who agrees to marry #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A young country boy who is in love with #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s protagonist and vice president in charge of operations of #X_0# Transcontinental. #X_0# is #X_1#’s greatest love and worst enemy. Her brilliant management style and unwavering commitment to the railroad enable her to remain in the world of the “looters”—Rand’s word for the people and government agencies that seize property from capitalists—and to keep her railroad running despite the growing chaos. In so doing, she continues to provide the looters with transportation that sustains their system. She mistakenly believes the looters are capable of reason and will understand their mistakes before it is too late. When she realizes the looters are in fact agents of death, she withdraws and is the last to join the strike.

-- #X_0# --
The greatest of the nation’s industrialists, #X_0# is a steel baron with an astonishing capacity to produce. He is also #X_1#’s lover for most of the novel. #X_0# represents a threat to the strikers because he continues to fight for his mills and inadvertently props up the looters’ regime. His main flaw is his willingness to accept the looters’ idea that he is obligated to serve others. When he finally gives up this premise, he sees the looters’ system for what it is and joins the strike.

-- #X_0# --
The man around whom the action of the novel revolves, #X_0# organizes and leads the strike of the mind. He is simultaneously the destroyer, the inventor of the revolutionary motor, #X_2#’s mysterious friend, and #X_1#’s greatest love. Brilliant and perceptive, he is the physical and intellectual representation of man’s ideal.

-- #X_0# --
An enormously wealthy and brilliant industrialist, #X_0# is the first to join #X_2#’s strike and the man who pays the highest price for it, losing his first and only love, #X_1#. #X_0# works as the strike’s most active recruiter, focusing much of his attention on #X_3#. By pretending to be a worthless playboy, #X_0# is able to hide his efforts to destroy #X_0# copper and thereby keep it out of the hands of the looters.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s brother and president of #X_0# Transcontinental. An inferior businessman, #X_3# excels at influence peddling and becomes highly skilled at manipulating the system. Though he claims to be motivated by both personal wealth and public service, his true motive is destruction of the productive. #X_3# carefully represses the nature of his depravity, but his final encounter with #X_4# completely shatters his illusions.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s assistant at #Y_0# and a hard worker dedicated to the preservation of the railroad. Through his friendship with the mysterious track worker in the cafeteria, #X_0# unwittingly provides the destroyer with valuable information about #X_2# and the railroad.

-- #X_0# --
Hank #X_0#’s lifeless, beautiful wife. #X_0# is dominated by a hatred of the good, and her purpose in life is to destroy her husband. Unlike #X_2#, who shares her need for destruction but deludes himself that he has other motivations, #X_0# is honest with herself about her goals.

-- #X_0# --
An oil tycoon who sparks the growth of #Y_0#’s industry through his innovations. When the government burdens #Y_0# with impossible regulations and demands, #X_0# refuses to cooperate and withdraws.

The author and protagonist of the Autobiography; he writes the work ostensibly to tell his son about his life and to provide a model of self-betterment for anyone interested. Born into a modest #Y_0# family, #X_0# moved to #Y_1# in his late teens and eventually opened up his own newspaper, #Y_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A local #Y_1# poet whom #X_2# befriends and with whom #X_2# travels to #Y_0#. #X_2# tells a story of a time when #X_0#, who was often disliked and thus overly criticized by his friends in the realm of poetry, asked #X_2# to read one of #X_0#'s poems as #X_2#'s own, which #X_2# did to very high praise. #X_0# traveled with #X_2# to #Y_0#, where he leeched off #X_2# most of the time and borrowed large sums of money that he never repaid. #X_2# and #X_0# ended up going separate ways when #X_2# hits on #X_0#'s girlfriend and is rejected.

#X_0# (also known as #X_3# Little,
#X_1#, and #X_2#)  --
The narrator and subject of the autobiography. As a young boy #X_3# is bright and popular but feels excluded by white people. He becomes a ruthless hustler on the streets of #Y_0# and #Y_1# but undergoes a change of heart during his time in prison. After his release, he develops into an aggressive and persuasive spokesman for #Y_2#. As an independent and international political leader, he is tolerant, meditative, and ambitious.

-- #X_0# --
The spiritual leader of #Y_0#. #X_2# treats #X_0# with immense respect even before he knows him, writing him letters daily while still in prison. Though he seems like a benevolent father figure, #X_0#becomes a jealous and defensive leader as his health fails and as #X_2# becomes more powerful.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s wife, a quiet and strong woman. The autobiography does not emphasize #X_0#’s role, though she acts as #X_1#’s secretary, housekeeper, and confidante. #X_0# endures his busy traveling and work schedule, gives birth to five of his children, and witnesses his assassination.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s best friend during his #Y_0# years. #X_0#is a musician who at first leads and then follows #X_1# into a life of crime. #X_0#is a foil for #X_1#: while #X_1# converts to an aggressive hustler lifestyle, #X_0#leads a comparatively normal life. The differences between the two men is clear in #X_0#’s surprise at #X_1#’s foul language and violent tendencies, which he witnesses when #X_1# returns to #Y_0# from #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s half-sister on his father’s side. When #X_1# is an adolescent, #X_0# provides him with a model of female strength and black pride. She represents family unity within the autobiography. She welcomes #X_1# into her home in #Y_0# and always supports him, later lending him money for his pilgrimage to #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s father. A preacher and political organizer from #Y_0#, #X_0# is a tall and outspoken authority figure in #X_1#’s early years. #X_0#’s assassination by whites for preaching the Black Nationalist ideas of #X_2# makes him a martyr for black nationalism.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s fair-skinned, black mother, who endures the worst of the Great Depression. For #X_2#, #X_0# represents the harm that the white government does even when it claims to be acting charitably. Welfare agents separate #X_0# from her children and put her in a mental hospital, and #X_2#’s insistence on visiting her regularly shows his strong commitment to her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s white girlfriend. #X_1# and #X_0#do not love each other but rather use each other as status symbols. #X_0#represents the tempting allure of white women for black men, and the emptiness of her relationship with #X_1# shapes #X_1#’s skepticism about interracial romance.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s first date, a quiet, middle-class black girl from Roxbury Hill. When #X_1# dumps #X_0#for #X_2#, #X_0#becomes involved with drugs and prostitution. #X_0#is an innocent victim of the ruthless and self-hating behavior that #X_1# observes in urban black communities.

-- #X_0# --
A Harlem pimp and drug dealer. As close friends, #X_2# and #X_0# work together until tension develops between them over #X_2#’s assault on one of #X_0#’s girlfriends. This episode shows that even the closest friendships easily crumble when gambling, drugs, and violence are involved.

-- #X_0# --
An older Harlem hustler. #X_0# pays #X_1# for helping him run an informal gambling system in Harlem until they break violently over a misunderstanding. #X_0#’s photographic memory and aptitude in math exemplify the wasted potential of the black ghetto.

-- #X_0# --
A prison inmate. #X_0#, the most vocal of #X_2#’s fellow inmates, makes speeches that gain him the respect of guards and prisoners alike. He demonstrates to #X_2# the power of independent thought and persuasive argument, and thus serves as an inspiration to #X_2# when #X_2# converts to #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The world heavyweight boxing champion. Generous and understanding, #X_0# provides a place for #X_2# to stay during the first days of #X_2#’s split from #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s younger brother. #X_1# takes #X_0# under his wing from an early age and continues to protect him in Harlem. #X_1#’s later justification of #X_0#’s eventual insanity as retribution for sinning shows #X_1#’s commitment to the principles of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the novel. She is a spunky woman who has always fought her way through the world and stood up for herself. She represents courage, fortitude, and determination. From the very beginning of the novel to the very end, #X_0# attempts to make herself as emotionally and physically free as possible. She is a physically strong woman who becomes a community leader because of her strength, insight, and character.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# adopted son. #X_0# represents insight, strength, and youth. He is a bright young man who desires change in the society and boldly makes an effort to help his people by building a school. He is well aware that he might be killed for his actions, as he is, but he insists on doing it anyhow. His bravery makes him a savior within his community.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s husband. #X_0# is kind, likable, and tough. His toughness gave him the courage to leave Colonel #X_2#'s plantation after finding another job. #X_0#'s desire to break horses shows his forceful personality and yearning for true manhood. #X_0#'s excellence at his work indicates his status as a truly strong man. Unfortunately, #X_0#'s desire to constantly demonstrate his manhood will lead to his death as he refuses to retire even though he is aging. #X_0#'s death when trying to capture the black stallion can be seen as his final attempt to claim the masculinity that whites had long denied him.

-- #X_0# --
The Master of the #X_0# Plantation and the father of #X_2#. #X_0#represents the old southern social order. He governs his plantation almost as men did during slavery. He seduces a black woman and fathers a child, #X_3#, but he refuses to accept this son as his own because he is black. #X_3# lives on the plantation and resembles him more than #X_0#'s white son, but for #X_0# the color barrier between them is larger than their blood connection. #X_0#'s inability to see beyond the old southern order leads to his rejection of #X_3# and the death of his other son, #X_2#. Because of his archaic beliefs, his legacy is ruined.

-- #X_0# --
The wife and mistress of the #X_0# plantation. #X_0# #X_0# #X_0# maintains the racial social order on the plantation. Her dislike of Robert #X_0#'s black son #X_5# most obviously indicates how she expects the traditional decorum of blacks. Still, her harsh treatment of #X_5# also relates to her dismay at her husband's infidelity. Her affection for her own son and her extreme grief at his suicide also makes her a sympathetic character. #X_3# makes #X_0# #X_0# #X_0# a sympathetic character who demonstrates the way that the strict patriarchy pushed women in the old southern realm aside.

-- #X_0# --
An old Cajun man who fishes near #X_1#'s cabin each day and who shoots #X_2# Douglass. Initially #X_0# is a friendly character, even though he speaks frequently about killing people. He and #X_1# are even friends. #X_0#'s willingness to shoot #X_2# shows him as a coward. #X_0# is a poor white Cajun who will follow the orders of the higher-ranking whites in order to get their acceptance. After #X_0# believes that #X_1# has cursed him, his status as a weak coward becomes more obvious since he fears going to hell so much that he beats his innocent daughter. #X_0# is so afraid of death that he screams for days before it comes. This cowardice toward the end of his life contrasts strongly with the bravery showed by #X_2# Douglass, the man he shot.

-- #X_0# --
The son of #X_2#, the owner of #Y_0#. #X_0# is a tragic figure who kills himself during the book because he cannot accept the social mores of the South. #X_0#'s first disappointment with the Southern order comes when his father forces his half-brother, #X_4#, off the plantation. #X_0# cannot understand why #X_4# has to leave because the white overseer beat him. #X_0#'s later love for #X_1# again steps outside of the rules proscribed by their culture. No one, not even #X_1#, supports #X_0#'s love of her. When she turns him down, he sees that the world is too harsh for him, and he kills himself. #X_0#'s love for his brother and for #X_1# is pure, and he cannot understand why anything can be wrong with them. #X_0# in many ways still maintains a sense of racial superiority because he is white, but the kind nature of his heart makes him willing to step outside the rules. And it is his willingness that leads to his dismay and suicide.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the unrecognized son of #X_1#. #X_0# looks and acts just like #X_1#, but because #X_0# is the son of a black woman he cannot claim #X_1#'s name. #X_0#'s knowledge of who is father is makes him slightly more obstinate than other blacks. #X_0# is not entirely a likeable character because he is so hardheaded and mischievous, but he is a sympathetic one. His father exiles him from the plantation eventually because #X_0#'s attitude is not becoming of a black man. #X_0# yearns to be the man that he is, but despite his heritage, his black race still requires that he cower in a white man's world. #X_0#'s presence is a testament to the widespread existence of black children of white men and the longtime rejection of them by their fathers both during and after slavery.

-- #X_0# --
The Creole schoolteacher that comes to live on the #X_2# plantation and with whom #X_3# falls in love. #X_0# #X_0# came to the plantation in an effort to make amends for her family's slaveholding past. Most of the plantation, however, believes her to be slightly uppity, because of her background. Her desire to be with dark skinned people is equally as racist as her Creole family's desire to only be with whites. #X_0# #X_0# is somewhat of a coquette, as she continues to befriend #X_3# but naïvely assumes that nothing will come of it. She never considered the relationship between them serious. Her attitude, to a great extent, leads to his death.

-- #X_0# --
A good friend of the #X_5# who is also #X_6#'s godfather, or #X_4#. #X_0#is a true gentleman who refuses to let violence against #X_2# follow #X_6#'s death. #X_0#'s wisdom leads to #X_2#'s flight and his speech about how all of them killed #X_6#, especially by supporting the culture that wore him down. #X_0#is an exceptional white man who seeks understanding in a time of prejudice and segregation.

-- #X_0# --
A boy born in the plantation whom everyone believes is going to be the "one". #X_0# is a messiah-like figure who will return to help mobilize the community toward action. The elders on the plantation want #X_0# to become a religious leader, but because of the changes in Civil Rights he becomes more interested in politics. #X_0#'s commitment and the final sacrifice of his life truly saves the other people from the fear that has governed them all their life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s best friend, whom he met at #Y_1# in #Y_0#. #X_0# is not from the high landowning class like the #X_2#, and #X_1# looks down on him for that reason. #X_0# is young, like #X_3#, but #X_0# maintains the classic southern ideas on race. Any meaningful relationship between #X_3# and a black woman is unthinkable in his eyes, as it is for most white men. After he learns of #X_3#'s death, he responds in the classic southern white way: he wants to blame the girl that #X_3# loved and have her killed. He serves as a contrast to #X_3#, who was willing to stretch the confining social limitations that society placed upon him. #X_0#'s character articulates the racist status quo, while simultaneously demonstrating the classicism within the white southern sphere.

-- #X_0# --
The man who reclaims the plantation where #X_1# first lived after slavery. #X_0# fought with #Y_0# and represents the old southern landowning order. #X_0# supports restrictions and possibly violence against his blacks if necessary, such as when he sent #Y_1# to get #X_3#. He also is slightly dishonest in the way he tries to keep #X_2# on the plantation by saying that #X_2# owes him money and by adding interest after #X_2# gets the cash.

-- #X_0# --
A Creole "hoodoo" woman whom #X_2# consults. #X_0# moved to a country town from #Y_0# because of the competition in the city. #X_0# speaks with a funny accent in order to affect a spiritual tone. In many ways, she is a comedic figure because her affectations suggest that she is just a plain black woman dressed up and acting like a sorceress for financial gain.

-- #X_0# --
The man who originally owns and runs the plantation on which #X_1# stays after slavery. He is a Republican who is willing to run the plantation with relative fairness for all the blacks. He employs a black schoolteacher and pays everyone fairly. #X_0#is a relatively good white man who suggests what the south could have become if the Republicans had stayed in control.

-- #X_0# --
A poor white man who takes #X_2# and #X_3# to his house when they are fleeing slavery. His wife has gone crazy during the war, and he has little to share with them, but he does so anyway and takes them to the safe location of Mr. #X_1#'s plantation. He represents kindness in the face of so much evil. Like his biblical namesake, he is a man who has seemingly endured much but who still maintains a sense of goodness and Godliness by being charitable.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s mother and the slave woman who leads the freedmen as they leave slavery. #X_0# is one of many physically and emotionally strong black women who dominate the novel.

-- #X_0# --
A slow witted woman at the #X_3# plantation who goes crazy after trying to win a race in the fields. #X_0# #X_0#'s ensuing insanity and slow wittedness suggest the harshness of the southern order upon the psychology of the people within it.

-- #X_0# --
The older black woman who works in #Y_0# at the ranch where #X_1# goes to break horses. #X_0# has become completely indoctrinated into slavery such that she cannot envision life without it. After she feels forced to leave the house, she dies soon after.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# great aunt. She raises him and represents one of the strong older black women who remain on the plantation.

-- #X_0# --
Another older black woman on the #X_2# plantation. She offers to drive the other protestors in her car.

-- #X_0# --
A woman who lives with #X_1# and helps to take care of her. She is one of the strong older black women in the book.

-- #X_0# --
A older black man on the #X_2# plantation who is supposed to drive Miss #X_1# to town on the day of the protest at the courthouse. #X_0# is too scared to do so, however. His fear is representative of the fear felt by most of the black people in the area because of years of abuse and control by the whites. Because #X_0# is an older black man, his inability to stand up for that in which he believes also suggests the way in which the southern order emasculated black men into inaction.

-- #X_0# --
A woman on the plantation who takes care of #X_1# after she thinks #X_1# was ravished.

-- #X_0# --
The local #X_0# in town. He is a classic white southern sheriff who seems totally indifferent to justice in the wake of #X_4# death. He supports #X_1# when #X_2# begs for peace, but it seems just as likely that he would look away if the #X_3# family proceeded with violence.

-- #X_0# --
One of the teenage boys who lives on the #X_1# plantation at the end of the book.

-- #X_0# --
The white girl to whom #X_1# is engaged.

-- #X_0# --
The white #Y_0# soldier who renames #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the protagonist of the novel, and the “awakening” to which the title refers is hers. The twenty-eight-year-old wife of a #Y_0# businessman, #X_0# suddenly finds herself dissatisfied with her marriage and the limited, conservative lifestyle that it allows. She emerges from her semi-conscious state of devoted wife and mother to a state of total awareness, in which she discovers her own identity and acts on her desires for emotional and sexual satisfaction. Through a series of experiences, or “awakenings,” #X_0# becomes a shockingly independent woman, who lives apart from her husband and children and is responsible only to her own urges and passions. Tragically, #X_0#’s awakenings isolate her from others and ultimately lead her to a state of total solitude.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# may be the most influential character in #X_2#’s awakening. She is unmarried and childless, and she devotes her life to her passion: music. A talented pianist and somewhat of a recluse, she represents independence and freedom and serves as a sort of muse for #X_2#. When #X_2# begins actively to pursue personal independence, she seeks #X_0#’s companionship. #X_0# warns #X_2# that she must be brave if she wishes to be an artist—that an artist must have a courageous and defiant soul. #X_0# is the only character in the novel who knows of the love between #X_4# and #X_2#, and she, thus, serves as a true confidante for #X_2# despite their considerably different personalities. #X_0# is also a foil for #X_2#’s other close female friend, #X_1#, who epitomizes the conventional and socially acceptable woman of the late nineteenth century.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s close friend, #X_0# represents the Victorian feminine ideal. She idolizes her children and worships her husband, centering her life around caring for them and performing her domestic duties. While her lifestyle and attitude contrast with #X_1#’s increasing independence, #X_0# unwittingly helps facilitate her friend’s transformation. Her free manner of discourse and expression, typical of Creole women of the time, acts as a catalyst for #X_1#’s abandonment of her former reserved and introverted nature. #Y_0# is also a foil for #X_2#, whose independent and unconventional lifestyle inspires #X_1#’s transgressions.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the twenty-six-year-old single man with whom #X_1# falls in love. Dramatic and passionate, he has a history of becoming the devoted attendant to a different woman each summer at #Y_0#. #X_0# offers his affections comically and in an over-exaggerated manner, and thus is never taken seriously. As the friendship between #X_0# and #X_1# becomes more intimate and complex, however, he realizes that he has genuinely fallen in love with #X_1#. He is torn between his love for her and society’s view that women are the possessions of their husbands.

-- #X_0# --
The seductive, charming, and forthright #X_0# is the Don Juan of the #Y_1# Creole community. #X_0# enjoys making conquests out of married women, and he becomes #X_1#’s lover while her husband is on a business trip to #Y_2#. Although #X_2# Lebrun is the man whom #X_1# truly loves, #X_0# satisfies #X_1#’s physical urges while #X_2# is in #Y_0#. Throughout their passionate affair, #X_1# retains authority and never allows #X_0# to own or control her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, a forty-year-old, wealthy #Y_0# businessman, is #X_1#’s husband. Although he loves #X_1# and his sons, he spends little time with them because he is often away on business or with his friends. Very concerned with social appearances, #X_0# wishes #X_1# to continue the practices expected of #Y_0# women despite her obvious distaste for them. His relationship with #X_1# lacks passion and excitement, and he knows very little of his wife’s true feelings and emotions.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_2# and #X_1#’s family physician. He is a fairly enlightened man, who silently recognizes #X_1#’s dissatisfaction with the restrictions placed on her by social conventions. When #X_2# consults with him about #X_1#’s unconventional behavior, the doctor suspects that #X_1# is in love with another man, although he keeps his suspicions to himself because he recognizes that there is little #X_2# can do if #X_1# is indeed in love with someone else and that any further constraints imposed on her will only intensify her revolt. #X_0# offers #X_1# his help and understanding and is worried about the possible consequences of her defiance and independence.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, a former Confederate officer in the Civil War, is #X_1#’s father. He is a strict Protestant and believes that husbands should manage their wives with authority and coercion. While #X_1#’s relationship with her father is not affectionate, she is surprised by how well she gets along with her father when they are together.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_1#’s wayward younger brother. He spends his time chasing women and refuses to settle down into a profession.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the widowed mother of #X_2# and #X_1#. She owns and manages the cottages on #Y_0# where the novel’s characters spend their summer vacations.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# lady in black is a vacationer at the #X_2# cottages on Grand Isle. She embodies the patient, resigned solitude that convention expects of a woman whose husband has died, but her solitude does not speak to any sort of independence or strength. Rather, it owes to a self-effacing withdrawal from life and passion out of utter respect for her husband’s death. Throughout the novel, the lady in black remains silent, which contributes to her lack of individuality and to her role within the text as the symbol of the socially acceptable husbandless woman.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# two lovers are vacationers at the #X_1# cottages on Grand Isle. #X_0#y represent the form of young love accepted by society. Always appearing in conjunction with the lady in black, the lovers represent the stage of a woman’s life that precedes her maternal duties.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0# twins are fourteen-year-old girls who vacation at Grand Isle with their family and who frequently entertain their fellow guests by playing the piano. #X_0#y represent the destiny of adolescent Victorian girls: chaste motherhood. Having been dedicated to the Virgin Mary at birth, they wear her colors at all times. Moreover, they embody society’s expectations of the way women should use art—as a way of making themselves more delightful to others, rather than as a means of self-expression.

-- #X_0# --
A tall, worldly woman in her forties, #X_0# spends time with many of the fashionable single men of #Y_0# under the pretext of finding a husband for her daughter. #X_1# is one of these young men, and the two call on #X_3# to attend the races and to accompany them to dinner—meetings that catalyze the affair between #X_3# and #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_1#’s younger sister. #X_1# was never close to her and she refuses to attend her wedding. #X_0# is #X_1# and #X_0#’s older sister. After their mother died, #X_0# took over the role of mother figure for her younger sisters.

-- #X_0# --
A young, pretty Spanish girl, #X_0# is a mischievous flirt who lives on Grand Isle. She seems to fancy both #X_4# and #X_5# and, along with #X_2#, is the picture of the self-demeaning coquetry that #X_3# avoids.

-- #X_0# --
When #X_1# feels faint at the Sunday service on the island of Chênière Caminada, she and #X_2# go to #X_0#’s for the day. A friendly inhabitant of the island, #X_0# takes them in and cares for #X_1#, to whom she tells stories of her life.

-- #X_0# --
Some of the guests present at the dinner party #X_1# holds to celebrate her move to the “pigeon house.”

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# and #X_0# are #X_2# and #X_3#’s two sons. They are four and five years old, respectively.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a middle-aged successful real estate broker in #Y_0#. When the novel opens, he is a typical member of #Y_0#'s hypocritical, ignorant, unthinking, conformist middle class. However, he is vaguely dissatisfied with the monotonous, conventional middle-class lifestyle. After his best friend, #X_2#, is sent to jail for shooting his wife in an argument, #X_0# briefly rebels against middle-class values. He has an affair, joins his mistress's Bohemian circle of friends, and voices liberal political opinions. However, his friends and associates quickly crush his rebellion by shunning him socially and refusing to do business with him. When Myra #X_0# falls seriously ill, #X_0# realizes that it is too late for him to rebel. He has too much to lose, and he doesn't want his family to suffer for his unorthodox behavior. He returns to his conventional life to regain his social status and respectability with a new understanding of the hypocritical, ignorant values of his class.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is George #X_0#'s dull but devoted wife. She is also dissatisfied with the monotonous, conventional middle-class lifestyle. She is deeply hurt by #X_0#'s affair, but when she falls seriously ill, #X_0# returns to his role as a responsible, family man.

-- #X_0# --

An opera diva used to the indulgence of the world. Over the course of the novel, every man who hears #X_0# sing falls in love with her. Eventually, #X_0# returns the love of #X_1#. While she is small in stature, #X_0# has an oversized presence.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s interpreter. #X_0#, who is in his twenties, has a great gift for languages, and the hostages and the terrorists rely on him to communicate with one another.

-- #X_0# --
A high-ranking Soviet official. #X_0# declares his love for #X_1# not because he hopes she will return it, but because expressing his love for her makes him feel better. #X_0# tells #X_1# how much he loved a beautiful book of paintings that his grandmother had when he was a child, and compares his love for that book to his love for her.

-- #X_0# --
A South American contractor and one of the captives. #X_0# and the vice president, #X_2#, often chat, talking about their early love affairs, their adoration for #X_1#, and the affection they feel for one of the young terrorists, #X_3#. #X_0# has nightmares that in his absence, young men will take advantage of his five daughters, wooing them into love affairs the way #X_0# himself wooed young girls when he was a young man.

#X_1#’s college boyfriend, he is an athletic, intelligent, good-looking man who graduated from #Y_0# and went to medical school. #X_0# cares for #X_1# but has conventional ideas about women’s roles and fails to understand #X_1#’s interest in poetry.

-- #X_0# --

#X_1#’s companion in #Y_0#, a blond, beautiful southern girl with a sharp tongue. #X_1# envies #X_0#’s nonchalance in social situations, and the two share a witty, cynical perspective on their position as guest editors for a fashion magazine. #X_0# represents a rebellion against societal convention that #X_1# admires but cannot entirely embrace.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s companion in the mental hospital. A large, horsy woman, #X_0# was a year ahead of #X_2# in college, and #X_2# envied her social and athletic success. #X_0# once dated #X_1#, #X_2#’s boyfriend.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, the protagonist of Beloved, is a proud and independent woman who is extremely devoted to her children. Though she barely knew her own mother, #X_0#’s motherly instincts are her most striking characteristic. Unwilling to relinquish her children to the physical, emotional, sexual, and spiritual trauma she endured as a slave at #Y_0#, she attempts to murder them in an act of motherly love and protection. She remains haunted by this and other scarring events in her past, which she tries, in vain, to repress.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s youngest child, #X_0# is the most dynamic character in the novel. Though intelligent, introspective, and sensitive, #X_0# has been stunted in her emotional growth by years of relative isolation. Beloved’s increasing malevolence, however, forces #X_0# to overcome her fear of the world beyond 124 and seek help from the community. #X_0#'s foray out into the town and her attempts to find permanent work and possibly attend college mark the beginning of her fight for independence and self-possession.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s identity is mysterious. The novel provides evidence that she could be an ordinary woman traumatized by years of captivity, the ghost of #X_2#’s mother, or, most convincingly, the embodied spirit of #X_2#’s murdered daughter. On an allegorical level, #X_0# represents the inescapable, horrible past of slavery returned to haunt the present. Her presence, which grows increasingly malevolent and parasitic as the novel progresses, ultimately serves as a catalyst for #X_2#’s, #X_1#, and #Y_0#’s respective processes of emotional growth.

-- #X_0# --
The physical and emotional brutality suffered by #X_0# at #Y_0# and as part of a chain gang has caused him to bury his feelings in the “rusted tobacco tin” of his heart. He represses his painful memories and believes that the key to survival is not becoming too attached to anything. At the same time, he seems to incite the opening up of others’ hearts, and women in particular tend to confide in him. #X_3# welcomes him to 124, where he becomes her lover and the object of #X_0#enver’s and #X_1#’s jealousy. Though his union with #X_3# provides him with stability and allows him to come to terms with his past, #X_0# continues to doubt fundamental aspects of his identity, such as the source of his manhood and his value as a person.

-- #X_0# --
After #X_1# buys his mother, #X_0#, her freedom, she travels to #Y_1#, where she becomes a source of emotional and spiritual inspiration for the city’s black residents. #X_0# holds religious gatherings at a place called #Y_3#, where she teaches her followers to love their voices, bodies, and minds. However, after #X_2#’s act of infanticide, #X_0# stops preaching and retreats to a sickbed to die. Even so, #X_0# continues to be a source of inspiration long after her death: in Part Three, her memory motivates #Y_2# to leave #Y_0# and find help. It is partially out of respect for #X_0# that the community responds to #Y_2#’s requests for support.

-- #X_0# --
Like #X_2#, #X_0# is considered by the community to be a figure of salvation, and he is welcomed at every door in town. An agent of #Y_4#, he helps #X_4# to freedom and later saves #X_3#’s life. A grave sacrifice he made during his enslavement has caused him to consider his emotional and moral debts to be paid off for the rest of his life, which is why he decided to rename himself “#X_0#.” Yet by the end of the book, he realizes that he may still owe protection and care to the residents of #Y_0#. Angered by the community’s neglect of #X_4#, #X_3#, and #Y_2#, #X_0# begins to question the nature of a community’s obligations to its members.

-- #X_0# --
Following Mr. #X_1#’s death, #X_0# takes charge of #Y_0#. Cold, sadistic, and vehemently racist, #X_0# replaces what he views as #X_1#’s too-soft approach with an oppressive regime of rigid rules and punishment on the plantation. Schoolteacher’s own habits are extremely ascetic: he eats little, sleeps less, and works hard. His most insidious form of oppression is his “scientific” scrutiny of the slaves, which involves asking questions, taking physical measurements, and teaching lessons to his white pupils on the slaves’ “animal characteristics.” The lower-case "s" of #X_0#’s appellation may have an ironic meaning: although he enjoys a position of extreme power over the slaves, they attribute no worth to him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s husband and #X_1# son, #X_0# is generous, kind, and sincere. He is very much alert to the hypocrisies of the #X_2#’ “benevolent” form of slaveholding. #X_0# eventually goes mad, presumably after witnessing schoolteacher’s nephews’ violation of #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, a light-skinned black woman who loathes her blond hair, is convinced that everyone despises her for being a woman of mixed race. Despite her feelings of alienation, she maintains a strong sense of community obligation and teaches the underprivileged children of #Y_0# in her home. She is skeptical of the supernatural dimensions of #Y_1#’s plea for assistance, but she nevertheless helps to organize the community’s delivery of food to #X_1#’s plagued household.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# worked with #Y_0# on #Y_1#. Traumatized by the sexual brutality of a white father and son who once held her captive, she believes, like #X_1#, that the past is best left buried. When it surfaces in the form of Beloved, #X_0# organizes the women of the community to exorcise Beloved from 124.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# are the comparatively benevolent owners of #Y_0#. The events at #Y_0# reveal, however, that the idea of benevolent slavery is a contradiction in terms. The #X_0#s’ paternalism and condescension are simply watered-down versions of schoolteacher’s vicious racism.

-- #X_0# --
Siblings #X_0# are white abolitionists who have played an active role in winning #X_3#’s freedom. Yet there is something disconcerting about the #X_0#s’ politics. #X_0# #X_0# longs a little too eagerly for the “heady days” of abolitionism, and #X_0# #X_0# demonstrates a condescending desire to “experiment” on #X_2# by sending her to #Y_0#. The distasteful figurine #X_2# sees in the #X_0#s’ house, portraying a slave and displaying the message “At Yo’ Service,” marks the limits and ironies of white involvement in the struggle for racial equality. Nevertheless, the siblings are motivated by good intentions, believing that “human life is holy, all of it.”

-- #X_0# --
A nurturing and compassionate girl who works as an indentured servant, #X_0# is young, flighty, talkative, and idealistic. She helps #X_1# when she is ill during her escape from #Y_0#, and when she sees #X_1#’s wounds from being whipped, #X_0# says that they resemble a tree. She later delivers baby #X_0#, whom #X_1# names after her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# A and #X_0# F are the brothers of #X_0# D. They were slaves at #Y_0# with him, #X_3#, #X_7#, and, earlier, #X_2#. #X_0# is another fellow slave. #X_0# and #X_0# A die during the escape from the plantation.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator and protagonist. #X_0# grew up in a family of merchants among the ethnic #Y_0#n community on the East African coast. Fearing imminent violence as nations throughout Africa gained independence, #X_0# relocated to a former colonial town in an unnamed nation in the continent’s interior. #X_0# sees himself as a perpetual outsider, never fully belonging to the Muslim community of #Y_0# from whence his family came and yet never quite African either. As such, he tends to situate himself as a detached observer, forever watching what’s happening without fully taking part in it.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s childhood friend. #X_0#, who also grew up on the East African coast, is the grandson of a wealthy money-lender. Though he was raised in luxury, #X_0#’s family lost its wealth and influence in a rebellion that raged along the coast upon independence. Feeling lost and alienated after graduating from a prestigious university in #Y_0#, #X_0# pledged to forge his own path and stamp out all sentimental desires for the past. He became a traveling lecturer who speaks on political and philosophical issues related to a newly modernizing Africa.

-- #X_0# --
A historian and former mentor to the President. Now in his fifties and supervising the polytechnic institute in the Domain, #X_0# has lived in Africa for many years. While working as a history professor at the university in the country’s capital, #X_0# became a mentor to the impressive young African man who would become the independent nation’s first president. Though #X_0# played a significant role in the young man’s early success, he’s found himself increasingly irrelevant now that the young man has risen to political fame. Even so, #X_0# remains stubbornly loyal to the President.

-- #X_0# --
A Belgian priest. #X_0#, who runs the local secondary school, is a relic of the colonial past. In his forties, #X_0# maintains a belief in European superiority and a reverence for European colonialism despite also nurturing a fascination with local African religion. He believes that “true” Africa is dying and works to collect as many masks and other emblems of African spiritual traditions as he can. He also believes that the town at the bend in the river may have its ups and downs, but it will always persist as local commercial center.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s assistant. #X_0# is a half-African boy who grew up on the East African coast in a compound belonging to #X_2#’s family. Originally known as #X_1#, he took on the name #X_0# when he left the coast to join #X_2# in the unnamed town at the bend in the river. His new name derives from the French word métis, which means “mixed” and refers to his mixed-race heritage. Though energetic and quick to adapt to his new life, and despite starting a family in the town, #X_0# never sheds his outsider status and grows increasingly morose and disenchanted.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s wife. Nearly thirty years her husband’s junior, #X_0# is a beautiful Belgian woman who strives to keep up an appearance of glamor but secretly feels disappointed with the course of her life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s customer from a remote village. #X_0# is one of #X_1#’s first and most loyal customers. Once every month she makes the arduous and dangerous journey from her remote village to the town, where she makes purchases on behalf of her community. #X_1# finds her a canny businesswoman and marvels at her resilience and no-nonsense attitude. Renowned locally as a powerful sorceress, #X_0# plies herself with protective ointments that give her a strong and distinctive scent.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s son. #X_0# is the child of #X_2# and a traveling trader from another tribe to the south. He spent his youth with his father’s tribe, but he moved to live with his mother’s people following his father’s death. #X_2# sends him to the town to attend the school there. After finishing, he attends the polytechnic institute at the nearby Domain, then moves to the capital for an administrative cadetship. #X_0#’s outlook and personality change throughout each of these phases of his life, and #X_1# sees these changes as reflecting the development of “the new African.”

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s friend and an entrepreneur. Like #X_1#, #X_0# is an ethnic Indian who has lived in Africa all his life. He and his wife, #X_2#, are both vain and strive to maintain the appearance of success and personal beauty, though they largely keep to themselves. #X_0# gets caught up easily in new money-making ideas, and after several failed ventures (some illegal), he opens a successful branch of the #Y_0# franchise. Despite his entrepreneurial drive and his frequent insistence on the need to “carry on,” #X_0#’s reluctance to imagine a different kind of life for himself belies an ultimately defeatist attitude.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s wife. #X_0# comes from a well-to-do Indian family that she spurned when she decided to marry #X_1#. Threats from her brothers led her to run away from the coast and settle with #X_1# in the African interior. #X_0# remains afraid of everyone and everything, and she worries that she has wasted her life by simply “carrying on” in Africa. Even more obsessed with personal beauty than her husband, she imagines traveling to #Y_0# to receive an expensive skin treatment.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# and #X_3#’s houseboy. #X_0# is a young African man who works in #X_1# and #X_3#’s house as a live-in servant and later becomes the unofficial “manager” of #X_1#’s #Y_0# branch. #X_2# sees #X_0# as eager to please his boss but otherwise vacant.

-- #X_0# --
A businessman and mentor to #X_2#. #X_0# has long been a friend of #X_2#’s family. As independence swept the continent and #X_0# sought to resettle in #Y_0#, he sold #X_2# his old shop in a central African town. Though always enthusiastic and forever seeking his next profitable business venture, #X_0# lives with the belief that his extraordinary luck as a businessman will one day run out and leave him ruined.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s daughter. #X_0#’s experience growing up endowed her with a worldly attitude. She sensibly trained as a pharmacist to ensure that she would have a job wherever her family might move next. Though she was informally betrothed to #X_2# from a young age, the engagement becomes formal when #X_2# visits #X_1#’s family in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The new owner of #X_2#’s shop. #X_0#, a local African mechanic, becomes the “state trustee” of #X_2#’s shop after the President announces the nationalization of all foreign-owned businesses. Though at first modest about his state-mandated position, #X_0# grows increasingly entitled and bold in the demands he makes of #X_2# and #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the epic, #X_0# is a Geatish hero who fights the monster Grendel, Grendel’s mother, and a fire-breathing dragon. #X_0#’s boasts and encounters reveal him to be the strongest, ablest warrior around. In his youth, he personifies all of the best values of the heroic culture. In his old age, he proves a wise and effective ruler.

-- #X_0# --
The king of the Danes. #X_0# enjoys military success and prosperity until Grendel terrorizes his realm. A wise and aged ruler, #X_0# represents a different kind of leadership from that exhibited by the youthful warrior Beowulf. He is a father figure to Beowulf and a model for the kind of king that Beowulf becomes.

-- #X_0# --
A demon descended from #X_2#, #X_0# preys on Hrothgar’s warriors in the king’s mead-hall, Heorot. Because his ruthless and miserable existence is part of the retribution exacted by God for #X_2#’s murder of #X_1#, #X_0# fits solidly within the ethos of vengeance that governs the world of the poem.

-- #X_0# --
An unnamed swamp-hag, #X_0# seems to possess fewer human qualities than #X_1#, although her terrorization of #X_2# is explained by her desire for vengeance—a human motivation.

-- #X_0# --
An ancient, powerful serpent, the #X_0# guards a horde of treasure in a hidden mound. Beowulf’s fight with the #X_0# constitutes the third and final part of the epic.

-- #X_0# --
The legendary Danish king from whom #X_1# is descended, #X_0# is the mythical founder who inaugurates a long line of Danish rulers and embodies the Danish tribe’s highest values of heroism and leadership. The poem opens with a brief account of his rise from orphan to warrior-king, concluding, “That was one good king” (11).

-- #X_0# --
The second king listed in the genealogy of Danish rulers with which the poem begins. #X_0# is the son of Shield Sheafson and father of #X_1#. The narrator presents #X_0# as a gift from God to a people in need of a leader. He exemplifies the maxim, “Behavior that’s admired / is the path to power among people everywhere” (24–25).

-- #X_0# --
The father of Hrothgar, Heorogar, Halga, and an unnamed daughter who married a king of the Swedes, #X_0# succeeded Beow as ruler of the Danes.

-- #X_0# --
Hrothgar’s wife, the gracious queen of the Danes.

-- #X_0# --
A Danish warrior who is jealous of Beowulf, #X_0# is unable or unwilling to fight Grendel, thus proving himself inferior to Beowulf.

-- #X_0# --
Hrothgar’s elder son, #X_0# stands to inherit the Danish throne, but #X_0#’s older cousin Hrothulf will prevent him from doing so. Beowulf offers to support the youngster’s prospect of becoming king by hosting him in Geatland and giving him guidance.

-- #X_0# --
The second son of Hrothgar.

-- #X_0# --
Hrothgar’s nephew, #X_0# betrays and usurps his cousin, Hrethic, the rightful heir to the Danish throne. #X_0#’s treachery contrasts with Beowulf’s loyalty to Hygelac in helping his son to the throne.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s trusted adviser.

-- #X_0# --
Beowulf’s uncle, king of the Geats, and husband of Hygd. #X_0# heartily welcomes Beowulf back from Denmark.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s wife, the young, beautiful, and intelligent queen of the Geats. #X_0# is contrasted with Queen #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A young kinsman and retainer of Beowulf who helps him in the fight against the dragon while all of the other warriors run away. #X_0# adheres to the heroic code better than Beowulf’s other retainers, thereby proving himself a suitable successor to Beowulf.

-- #X_0# --
Beowulf’s father, Hygelac’s brother-in-law, and Hrothgar’s friend. #X_0# is dead by the time the story begins, but he lives on through the noble reputation that he made for himself during his life and in his dutiful son’s remembrances.

-- #X_0# --
The Geatish king who took Beowulf in as a ward after the death of Ecgtheow, Beowulf’s father.

-- #X_0# --
Beowulf’s childhood friend, whom he defeated in a swimming match. Unferth alludes to the story of their contest, and Beowulf then relates it in detail.

-- #X_0# --
A figure from Norse mythology, famous for slaying a dragon. #X_0#’s story is told in praise of Beowulf and foreshadows Beowulf’s encounter with the dragon.

-- #X_0# --
An evil king of legend. The scop, or bard, at Heorot discusses #X_0# as a figure who contrasts greatly with Beowulf.

-- #X_0# --
A wicked queen of legend who punishes anyone who looks at her the wrong way. #X_0#’s story is told in order to contrast her cruelty with #X_2#’s gentle and reasonable behavior.

-- #X_0# --
The author and #X_1#’s father. #X_0# is a dynamic intellectual with passionate opinions about being black in #Y_0#, which change and evolve over the course of the book. His childhood in the ghettos of #Y_1# serves as the backdrop for all his later experiences.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’ fifteen-year-old son, to whom the book is written. #X_1# makes it clear that their childhoods are different. #X_0# was raised in #Y_0# and has traveled with his father. Because of his environment, #X_0# has experienced less fear than #X_1#, but still recognizes the same gap between black and white that his father did.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’ wife, whom #X_1# only refers to as “your mother.” She meets #X_1# at #Y_0#, and engenders key changes within #X_1#, such as teaching him how to be a loving father and sharing her love of travel. She inspires him to move to #Y_1# and travel to #Y_2#, which provides #X_1# a wider perspective on the world.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’ contemporary at #X_3# who was murdered by police. His murder has a serious impact on #X_2# and darkens his view toward the police and all of white #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# #X_0#’ mother and a radiologist. She is the central character in Part III, when #X_2# visits her years after #X_3#’s murder. #X_2# respects her composure and determination to break the poverty cycle and give her children an excellent life.

-- #X_0# --
Close friends of the #X_1# family (not blood relatives). #X_1# meets #X_0# #X_0# at #Y_0# and refers to him as a fellow searcher.

-- #X_0# --
An unnamed, bisexual love interest for #X_1# at #X_2#. She challenges #X_1#’ prejudicial views towards bisexual and gay people and is the first to show him true tenderness. She teaches him that love is heroic, but does not return #X_1#’ interest romantically.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’ mother and father. #X_1# refers to them anecdotally and says their love was hard, not tender. #X_1#’ father once worked as a librarian at #Y_0#, and he provided #X_1# with many books from a young age.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’ mother-in-law. She makes an impression on #X_1# when she tells him to take care of her daughter, #X_2#. She helps #X_1# realize the magnitude of his responsibility as a partner and father.

-- #X_0# --
Interviewer for a popular news #X_0#. Her interview with #X_1# opens the book, and by the end, she still does not seem to fully grasp his point about black bodies. Her lack of understanding represents the larger whole of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The central figure of the New Testament, whose life, death, and resurrection are chronicled in the books. The four Gospels describe #X_0#’s life until his resurrection, and the remainder of the New Testament concerns itself with the community of followers of #X_0# that steadily grows after his death.

-- #X_0# --
More than half of the books in the New Testament have been attributed to #X_0#, the great missionary who directs the spread of #Y_0# after the death of Jesus. In these books, #X_0# uses his keen mind and robust intellect to develop #Y_0#’s first sophisticated theology. In the period immediately following Jesus’s death, he is an active persecutor of Jesus’s followers, but he later converts and becomes the most active proponent of Christ’s disciples.

-- #X_0# --
The first of Jesus’s disciples. Extremely devoted to Jesus and his mission, Simon is able to recognize Jesus as the Messiah before the other apostles. As a result, Jesus makes him the “rock”—renaming Simon “#X_0#,” which means rock—on which his church would be built (Matthew 16:13–20). Although #X_0# denies his association with Jesus after Jesus’s arrest, #X_0# later becomes one of the leaders of the church in Jerusalem.

-- #X_0# --
The forerunner to Jesus, spreading the word of Jesus’s imminent arrival. #X_0# is an old ascetic who lives in the desert, wears a loincloth, and feeds on locusts and honey.

-- #X_0# --
A female follower of Jesus since the time of his Galilean ministry, when he exorcises her of seven demons (Luke 8:2). #X_0# is a close friend of Jesus. She is one of the women who discover that Jesus’s body is not in his grave. Following this event, she witnesses the resurrected Jesus. She is also known as #X_0# of Magdala.

-- #X_0# --
As prefect, #X_0# governs Judea by the authority of #Y_0# during the time of Jesus’s trial in Jerusalem. The Gospels differ on the extent of #X_0#’s responsibility for Jesus’s crucifixion. What is clear, however, is that #X_0# holds the ultimate authority to determine whether or not Jesus should be executed.

-- #X_0# --
Praised early in Acts for his generosity toward the church, #X_0# later becomes one of Paul’s traveling companions and fellow missionaries, joining Paul in spreading the Gospel among the Gentiles.

-- #X_0# --
One of the Twelve Apostles, #X_0# betrays Jesus to the authorities in exchange for thirty pieces of silver. According to Matthew, #X_0# commits suicide out of remorse (Matthew 27:3–10).

-- #X_0# --
A leader of the Hellenists, a faction of the Jewish Christians, in #Y_0# during the years after Jesus’s ascension. #X_0# preaches against the temple (Acts 6–7). When brought for trial before the Jewish court, #X_0# seals his fate by issuing a ringing condemnation of the Jewish leadership.

-- #X_0# --
The traveling companion and fellow missionary of #X_2#. #X_0# coauthors letters with #X_2#—such as 1 Corinthians and Philippians—and serves as his emissary throughout the Christian communities of the Mediterranean.

-- #X_0# --
Luke’s narrative of #X_0#’s infancy focuses heavily on the courage and faith of #X_0# who becomes impregnated by the Holy Spirit. She is also one of the only people who remains with #X_0# through the crucifixion. Gospel writers who have a high esteem for the female leaders in the early church community point to Mary as a model of discipleship.

-- #X_0# --
Mary’s husband. #X_0# is a direct paternal descendent of the great King David, which makes Jesus an heir to the Davidic line. This heritage reinforces Jesus’s place in the Jewish tradition.

-- #X_0# --
A traveling companion of Paul. Christian tradition dating back to the second century a.d. claims that #X_0# is the author of the Gospel that bears his name and of Acts of the Apostles.

-- #X_0# --
The high priest who presides over Jesus’s trial. Though it is Pilate who declares the verdict of Jesus’s guilt, the Gospel writers are insistent that #X_0# is also responsible for the crucifixion.

-- #X_0# --
The King of Palestine from 37 to 4 b.c. According to #X_1#, #X_0# hears of Jesus’s birth and decides to kill the child, who is prophesied to become king of the Jews. To evade #X_0#’s orders, Joseph takes Jesus and Mary to Egypt.

-- #X_0# --
The creator of the world and an all-powerful being. #X_0# calls himself the only true deity worthy of human worship. As the figurehead of #Y_0# and the force behind every event, #X_0# acts as the unseen hero of the Old Testament. #X_0# reveals his intentions by speaking to people. Physical manifestations of #X_0# are always indirect or symbolic. #X_0# appears in many different forms, including an angel, a wrestler, a burst of fire, and a quiet whisper.

-- #X_0# --
The patriarch of the Hebrew people. #X_0# is traditionally called “Father #X_0#” because the Israelite people and their religion descend from him. God establishes his covenant, or promise, with #X_0#, and God develops an ongoing relationship with the Israelites through #X_0#’s descendants. #X_0# practices the monotheistic worship of God, and his resilient faith in God, despite many challenges, sets the pattern for the Israelite religion’s view  of righteousness.

-- #X_0# --
The reluctant savior of #Y_0# in its exodus from Egyptian bondage to the promised land. #X_0# mediates between #X_1# and the people, transforming the #Y_0#ites from an oppressed ethnic group into a nation founded on religious laws. #X_0#’s legendary miracles before #X_2#, along with his doubts and insecurities, make him the great mortal hero of the Old Testament. He is the only man ever to know #X_1# “face to face.” Four out of the five books of the Pentateuch are devoted to #X_0# and #Y_0#’s activities under  his leadership.

-- #X_0# --
The king of #Y_0# and the founder of Jerusalem, or “Zion.” #X_0#’s reign marks the high point of #Y_0# in the biblical narrative. Although #X_0#’s claim to the throne is threatened by Saul and by #X_0#’s own son, Absalom, #X_0# maintains his power by blending shrewd political maneuvering with a magnanimous and forgiving treatment of his enemies. #X_0#’s decision to bring the Ark of the Covenant—#Y_0#’s symbol of God—to the capital of Jerusalem signals the long-awaited unification of the religious and political life of #Y_0# in the promised land.

-- #X_0# --
The grandson of Abraham, #X_0# is the third patriarch of the Israelite people and the father of the twelve sons who form the tribes of Israel. #X_0# experiences a life fraught with deception, bewilderment, and change. He steals his brother Esau’s inheritance right and wrestles with #Y_0# on the banks of the Jabbok River. Appropriately, the nation that springs from #X_0#’s children derives its name from #X_0#’s #Y_0#-given name, “Israel.” “Israel” means “struggles with #Y_0#,” and #X_0#’s struggles are emblematic of the tumultuous story of the nation of Israel.

-- #X_0# --
Jacob’s son and the head official for the Pharaoh of Egypt. Despite being sold into slavery by his brothers, #X_0# rises to power in Egypt and saves his family from famine. #X_0#’s calm and gracious response to his brothers’ betrayal introduces the pattern of forgiveness and redemption that characterizes the survival of the Israelite people throughout the  Old Testament.

-- #X_0# --
Israel’s first king. After God chooses #X_0# to be king, #X_0# loses his divine right to rule Israel by committing two religious errors. #X_0# acts as a character foil to David, because his plot to murder David only highlights David’s mercy to #X_0# in return. #X_0#’s inner turmoil over the inscrutability of God’s exacting standards makes him a sympathetic but tragic figure.

-- #X_0# --
David’s son and the third king of Israel. #X_0# builds the opulent #Y_1# in #Y_0# and ushers in Israel’s greatest period of wealth and power. God grants #X_0# immense powers of knowledge and discernment in response to #X_0#’s humble request for wisdom. #X_0#’s earthly success hinders his moral living, however, and his weakness for foreign women and their deities leads to Israel’s downfall.

-- #X_0# --
The prophets who oppose the worship of the god Baal in #Y_0#. After the division of #Y_0# into two kingdoms, #X_0# and his successor, #X_0#, represent the last great spiritual heroes before #Y_0#’s exile. Their campaign in northern #Y_0# against King Ahab and Jezebel helps to lessen #Y_0#’s growing evil but does not restore #Y_0#’s greatness. #Y_0#’s demise makes #X_0# and #X_0# frustrated doomsayers and miracle workers rather than national leaders or saviors.

-- #X_0# --
The first man and woman created by God. #X_0# and #X_0# introduce human evil into the world when they eat the fruit of a tree God has forbidden them to touch.

-- #X_0# --
The survivor of God’s great flood. #X_0# obediently builds the large ark, or boat, that saves the human race and the animal kingdom from destruction. #X_0# is the precursor to #X_1#, because #X_0# represents the first instance of God’s attempt to form a covenant with humanity through one person.

-- #X_0# --
Abraham’s son and the second member in the triumvirate of Israel’s patriarchs. #X_0#’s importance consists less in his actions than in the way he is acted upon by others. God tests Abraham by commanding him to kill his son #X_0#, and #X_0#’s blindness and senility allow his own son Jacob to steal #X_0#’s blessing and the inheritance of God’s covenant.

-- #X_0# --
Moses’s brother, who assists Moses in leading the Israelites out of Egypt. God designates #X_0# to be the first high priest in Israel. The quiet #X_0# often stands between Moses and the people to soften Moses’s angry response to their sinful behavior.

-- #X_0# --
The successor of Moses as #Y_0#’s leader. #X_0# directs the people in their sweeping military campaign to conquer and settle the Promised Land. #X_0#’s persistent exhortations to #Y_0# to remain obedient to God imply that he doubts #Y_0# will do so. His exhortations foreshadow #Y_0#’s future religious struggles.

-- #X_0# --
One of Israel’s judges and an epic hero who thwarts the neighboring Philistines with his superhuman strength. #X_0# is rash, belligerent, and driven by lust for foreign women—qualities that contradict Jewish religious ideals. #X_0#’s long hair is both the source of his strength and the symbol of his religious devotion to God as a Nazirite. #X_0#’s character demonstrates that in the bible, heroic potential is gauged not by human excellence but by faith in God.

-- #X_0# --
The last of Israel’s judges and the prophet who anoints both #X_1# and David as king. #X_0# fulfills political and priestly duties for Israel, but he ushers in Israel’s monarchy mainly as a prophet—one who pronounces God’s words and decisions. #X_0#’s stoic and aloof position in Israel allows #X_1# to struggle with God and his fate on his own.

-- #X_0# --
David’s son, who attempts to overthrow his father’s throne. #X_0#’s violent rise to power suggests that the evil that corrupts Israel comes from within.

-- #X_0# --
King #X_2#’s loyal military commander. #X_0# serves as a foil to #X_2#’s successful combination of religion and politics. #X_0#’s reasonable desire to see justice and retribution delivered to the kingdom’s traitors emphasizes the unusual quality of #X_2#’s kindness to his enemies.

-- #X_0# --
The opposing kings who divide Israel into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. #X_0# and #X_0# introduce rampant worship of idols and false gods into their kingdoms. Each king acts both as a point of contrast and a double, or mirror, for the other, allowing the biblical reader to trace the rapid growth of evil in Israel’s two kingdoms.

-- #X_0# --
The most wicked rulers of Israel. #X_0# and #X_0# spread cult worship of the pagan god Baal throughout the northern kingdom. Dogs gather to eat their blood at their deaths, fulfilling Elijah’s prophecy.

-- #X_0# --
A timid Jewish girl who becomes the queen of #Y_0#. #X_0# boldly and cunningly persuades the king of #Y_0# to remove his edict calling for the death of the exiled Jews.

-- #X_0# --
The subject of God and #X_1#’s cosmic experiment to measure human faithfulness to God in the midst of immense pain. #X_0# scorns false contrition and the advice of his friends, preferring instead to question God’s role in human suffering. He retains an open and inquisitive mind, remaining faithful in his refusal to curse God.

-- #X_0# --
The novel's protagonist and in many ways its modern "knight." #X_0# is a private detective who is asked to deal with a blackmailing case for the wealthy General #X_1#. Although he is apparently attractive to women, he is not prone to take advantage of them, and he remains respectful in his own hard- boiled way. #X_0# is a man of the streets, tough and clever, but he is honest and good-willed. Other characters even call him naïve in several instances. His dialogue and manner of speaking are particularly raw and witty, often brash. A good judge of human character, he is perfect for his line of work.

-- #X_0# --
The rich and very ill oil baron who has fathered two wild daughters—#X_8# and #X_2# #X_0#—and who has hired #X_6# as a private detective. #X_4# implies that the #X_0# has fathered #X_2# quite late in life and that his life has wild in its own fashion, and corrupt as well. Nevertheless, we may feel sorry for #X_0# because he seems to have a genuinely sentimental side to him. Although he is aware of his daughters' wild behavior, he is unaware of their true malice, particularly #X_2#'s. It is #X_0#that introduces both plot lines—that of #X_5# and that of #X_7#.

-- #X_0# --
A pornographer who runs an illegal smut rental shop under the guise of a rare bookstore. #X_0#, who is homosexual (or perhaps bisexual), blackmails General #X_3#, and murdered in the act of attempting to further his blackmail by taking nude pictures of #X_2#. Though #X_0# is murdered early on in the novel, his death causes a series of events that set the plot in motion.

-- #X_0# --
An ex-bootlegger and husband of Vivian #X_1#. #X_0# is somewhat of a phantom character: we never meet him because he is dead long before the narrative begins. He remains, however, one of the novel's main characters in the sense that much of the novel revolves around him and the search for him. General #X_1# wants #X_0# found because he had been a good friend to the General, sweating with him in the greenhouse many a day, providing conversation to a sick and dying man. In the end, #X_0# is one of the very few characters who is saved from the plight of the novel and its aftermath—he exists only in a long sleep, "the big sleep," far away from the everyday reality of a seedy #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The elder of General #X_0#'s wild daughters. #X_0# is seductive but dangerous, a beautiful and smart temptress whose dark eyes hide many secrets. She is a gambler and a drinker and an accomplice to murder. #X_0# is a spoiled brat who always gets her way, and she is capable of cruelty. Nevertheless, it is possible that she has murdered her husband all to keep her father, General #X_0#, from the pain of the truth.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s younger sister. #X_0# is flirtatious, wears provocative clothing (and occasionally none at all), and could be considered not only a psychotic but also a nymphomaniac. She sucks her thumb, giggles, and has a habit of repeating "You're cute" to the men who cross her path. Whether or not #X_0# is a nymphomaniac, she is clearly prone to drinking, drugs, and sexual behavior, and is mentally unstable. Beneath her innocent, thumb-sucking, child-like veneer, she is the murderess of #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The novel's antagonist, the thoroughly corrupt leader of a gambling racket who has at least an indirect hand in almost all the murders that take place in the novel. Though #X_0# is a ruthless man, he will not taint his own hands with blood; instead, he hires others to do his dirty work. He manages a hold on many of the characters in the book through his manipulative threats and offered "protection."

-- #X_0# --
The #X_6#' chauffeur, a young man. #X_0# is in love with #X_2# Sternwood, and tries to run away with her, but is jailed because #X_7#, #X_2#'s sister, presses charges. The only way #X_0# can see to save #X_2# and her name is to murder #X_5#. Not very much is known about #X_0#, as his is the only death in the novel that remains ambiguous—whether he commits suicide or is killed is unclear. Because we do not know the nature of his death, we do not know how he feels about the murder he commits. Regardless, #X_0# is one of the two characters in the novel—#X_4# being the other—who "kill for love."

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s young and handsome lover. #X_0# is both despicable and endearing: his crude, limited vocabulary annoys #X_4# while he is under his custody for killing #X_2#. The boy kills #X_2# thinking that #X_2# has killed #X_3#, his lover. However, #X_0# honors #X_3#'s body in a ritualistic way, which makes us empathetic to what he may be feeling under his "tough kid" front.

-- #X_0# --
A man who tries to take over #X_3#'s porn racket. #X_0# is a common criminal who blackmails and gets involved in any scheme or illegal activity that might make him a dollar. He blackmails #X_5# with the pictures of #X_2# he has in his possession. He is not incredibly smart, and his life seems almost an accident, just like his death, which is a mere misunderstanding—#X_4# thinks it is #X_0# who has killed #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The front girl for #Y_0#'s pornography rentals. #X_0# is the equivalent of #X_2#: she is a common criminal, a grifter in search of a buck. She has an expensive drug addiction that has landed her in a deep hole. #X_0# takes up with #X_2# and then with #X_3#, both times in schemes to make an easy dollar. She is unhappy with her life, but she does nothing to better herself, instead blaming the men around her.

-- #X_0# --
A man involved in crime, but for whom crime is the wrong business. Indeed, though #X_0#is bad at criminal activity, he seems to have no other option. He is bad at tailgating, as illustrated by his poor performance in following #X_5#. He plans a moneymaking scheme with #X_1#—trading his knowledge of the hiding place of #X_6# (#X_3# wife) for money—but gets killed before he ever sees the money. #X_0# is not very smart, but he illustrates a good will when he gives #X_2# the wrong address and when he protects #X_1#, his partner in crime.

-- #X_0# --
The local District Attorney.

-- #X_0# --
The #Y_0#'s chief investigator. #X_0# is a friend of #X_3# and tells the detective about the #X_4# job. #X_2# uses #X_0# and the other "cops" to illustrate a tension between "coppers" and detectives. #X_0# is, generally, a good person.

-- #X_0# --
A local police captain who appears to feel a rivalry with #X_2#, or perhaps with private detectives in general.

-- #X_0# --
An officer at #Y_0# who chides #X_2# for taking matters into his own hands.

-- #X_0# --
The loyal and faithful wife of #X_2#. Though rumors abound that #X_0# has run off with #X_4#, this is not the case. #X_0# allows herself to be hidden in order to protect her husband, whom she does not believe or want to believe to be a crooked gambler and a ruthless murderer. #X_0# becomes a symbol under the name of "#X_5# name that #X_3#, who is taken by #X_0#, calls her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# cruel, rash, and trigger-happy gunman. #X_0# poisons #X_3# with cyanide and attempts to kill #X_4#.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_1#' butler.

-- #X_0# --
Discovered on a doorstep as an infant, #X_0# is a fine physical specimen at age twenty-one, renowned for his good looks and gentle, innocent ways. Upon taking up as a young seaman in the service of His Majesty the King of #Y_0#, #X_0# grows into the near-perfect image of what #X_1# calls the “Handsome Sailor,” an ideal specimen who inspires love and admiration in all his fellows. While working on board the merchant ship Rights-of-Man, #X_0# is impressed into naval duty as a foretopman (a sailor who sits atop the foremast or above) on board the warship H.M.S. Bellipotent. Although much younger than most of the Bellipotent’s crewmen, the cheerful, innocent young man quickly gains back the popularity he had previously enjoyed, earning the nickname “Baby #X_0#” in the process. He has several shortcomings, however, including an inability to perceive ill will in other people. He also has an unpredictable tendency to stutter, and at certain crucial moments he is rendered completely speechless.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# of the H.M.S. Bellipotent. A bachelor of aristocratic lineage, the forty-year-old #X_0# has made his mark as a distinguished sailor. His nickname, “Starry #X_0#,” seems fitting for this abstracted, intellectual figure who often shuts himself up at sea with his books. #X_0# remains somewhat aloof and diffident among his peers, though he is not haughty.

-- #X_0# --
The master-at-arms of the Bellipotent, an office equivalent to chief of police on board the ship. Behind his back, the crew refers to #X_0# with the derogatory nickname “#X_1#.” At age  thirty-five, #X_0# is lean and tall, with a protruding chin and an authoritative gaze. His brow bespeaks cleverness, and his black hair contrasts starkly with his pallid complexion. Because of his pale face, he stays out of the sun as much as possible. The narrator gives few details about #X_0#’s past, although speculation runs rampant among the crewmembers. It is known that after entering the navy unusually late in life, #X_0# rose through the ranks to attain his present position on the strength of his sobriety, deference to authority, and patriotism. However, his compliant exterior disguises a cruel and sinister streak, which the narrator explains is actually a natural tendency toward evil and depravity.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s acquaintance and confidante aboard the Bellipotent. A wizened old sailor with beady eyes, the #X_0# listens and occasionally issues inscrutable, oracular responses when #X_1# seeks out his confidence. At other times, however, the #X_0# is decidedly reticent and unhelpful.

-- #X_0# --
A brilliant yet misguided scientist and the protagonist of the story. #X_0#’s experiments and creations have made him famous in the scientific community. He has investigated volcanoes, mines, and clouds; bottled the world’s most delicious scents; created a powerful poison; and made a potion capable of erasing physical flaws such as freckles. Although his intentions are good, #X_0# is a selfish and cruel man whose delusions ultimately kill his wife.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s wife. A beautiful, intelligent, and caring woman, #X_0# is physically and spiritually lovely. Her only flaw is a small red birthmark shaped like a tiny hand on her left cheek. #X_0# worships her husband and submits to his unreasonable demands, despite her suspicions that they will kill her.

-- #X_0# --
#Y_0#’s assistant. A hulking, strong, grubby man, #X_0# is an able helper but simultaneously disgusted by #Y_0#’s desire to erase #X_1#’s birthmark. Because #X_0# represents the physical side of existence, his disgust is a strong indictment of #Y_0#. Ironically, #X_0# feels more compassion for #X_1# than her own husband does.

-- #X_0# --
Author, narrator, and protagonist of Black Boy. #X_0# is an unpredictable bundle of contradictions: he is timid yet assured, tough yet compassionate, enormously intelligent yet ultimately modest. Passive-aggressive as a young boy, #X_0# either says very little or becomes melodramatic and says too much. Growing up in an abusive family environment in the racially segregated and violent American South, #X_0# finds his salvation in reading, writing, and thinking. He grows up feeling insecure about his inability to meet anyone’s expectations, particularly his family’s wish that he accept religion. Even though he remains isolated from his environment and peers, at the autobiography’s end #X_0# has come to accept himself. Black Boy testifies to his gifted observational powers and his ability to reflect upon the psychological struggles facing black Americans.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother. Tough on #X_1# and certainly unafraid to administer a beating when she believes it is appropriate, #X_0# nevertheless loves her son and is the person most resembling an advocate in his life. Despite falling into ill health and becoming partially paralyzed, she maintains an optimistic outlook on life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s maternal grandmother. Austere and unforgiving, #X_0# is a very strict #Y_0# and runs her household accordingly. She thinks #X_1# is sinful, has little tolerance for his antics, and is inclined to demonstrate her disapproval with a quick backhanded slap across his mouth. Like her husband, #X_1# Wilson, #X_0# is the child of slaves. Due to her partially white ancestry, she looks somewhat white.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s younger brother. Born Leon #X_0# Wright, he goes by the name #X_0#. #X_0# does not contribute much to the story of #X_1#: a few times, he limply objects to something naughty that #X_3# is planning to do, like burn straws in a fireplace or hang a kitten. In this sense, he serves as one of #X_3#’s critics.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#’s sisters. #X_0# lives at home with #X_2# in #Y_0#, #Y_1#. She shares her mother’s spite for #X_3# and tries not to miss any opportunity to beat or humiliate him. She shares #X_2#’s intense religious nature and teaches at a religious school that #X_3# briefly attends.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s maternal grandfather and a former soldier in #Y_0# during the Civil War. Sour and remote, #X_0# is forever bitter that a clerical error has deprived him of his war pension.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s father. Although #X_0# is physically intimidating and frequently beats #X_1#, he abandons the family and proves to be simple, weak, and pathetic.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s second husband. The #X_0# is an outlaw and, when he begins courting #X_1#, he visits only at night. After he apparently kills a white woman, he and #X_1# flee to #Y_0#. Several years after that, he deserts #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#’s brothers. #X_0#briefly houses #X_2# after his mother becomes ill. #X_0# is a just, upright man who seems genuinely concerned for #X_2#’s welfare, although perhaps a little strict.

-- #X_0# --
Another of #X_2#’s brothers. Like Aunt #X_1#, #X_0# finds #X_3# particularly galling and seems to leap at any opportunity to beat or ridicule him.

-- #X_0# --
A young #X_0# who briefly rents a room in #X_3#’s house. Bookish and dreamy, she introduces #X_4# to the imaginative pleasures of fiction by telling him the story of #X_1# and His Seven Wives. #X_3#, however, views #X_2#’s stories as sinful and effectively forces #X_2# to move out.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#’s boyhood friends. #X_0#, like #X_1#, is intelligent, but he has a sense of when blacks need to abide by the rules—a sense #X_1# lacks. #X_0# displays the compassionate concern of a true friend when he advises #X_1# on how to survive in the racist white world.

-- #X_0# --
Two white Southerners who run #X_1# off his job at the optical shop in #Y_0#, #Y_1#. Though technically two characters, #X_0# are unified in their bestial treatment of #X_1# and essentially operate as one.

-- #X_0# --
A white Northerner who runs the optical shop where #X_3# works. #X_0# is a fair and unprejudiced man, who is sad to see #X_3# go when #X_1# and #X_2# run him off the job.

-- #X_0# --
A white Southerner at #X_3#’s job at the optical shop in #Y_0#, #Y_1#. Racist and destructive, #X_0# pretends to be #X_3#’s friend but then tells lies in an attempt to get #X_3# and #X_2# to kill each other.

-- #X_0# --
A young black man who works at a rival optical shop in #Y_0#. The fight between #X_2# and #X_0# demonstrates that racism’s power to instill fear in blacks is so great that it can lead two black men who truly like each other to fight each other viciously.

-- #X_0# --
White Jewish shopkeepers who employ #X_1# in #Y_0#. #X_0# treat #X_1# with genuine respect and care, but #X_1# assumes that because they are white they will act just like most Southern whites. #X_0# help #X_1# begin his journey toward accepting some well-meaning white people, even though he treats them poorly at the time.

-- #X_0# --
The black elevator man in the building in #Y_0# where #X_1# works. #X_0# is witty, intelligent, and has a sense of pride in his race. However, much to #X_1#’s horror, #X_0# engages in supremely demeaning behavior to earn money.

-- #X_0# --
A white Irish Catholic worker at the optical shop in #Y_1#. In stark counterpoint to #X_1#, #X_0# does not explicitly profess to be #X_2#’s friend, but he proves to be a genuine friend by letting #X_2# borrow his library card to obtain books from the whites-only library. When #X_0# learns that #X_2# is moving to #Y_0#, the quick smile he flashes suggests that he is pleased #X_2# is moving on to a better life.

-- #X_0# --
An escapee from a mental institution who suddenly appears at a meeting of #Y_2#, a revolutionary artists’ organization #X_2# joins in #Y_0#. #X_0# illustrates the vulnerability of #Y_1# to fraudulent acts by individuals.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
A high-ranking black Communist suspicious of #X_1#’s interviews with #X_2#. #X_0#’s  rough, peremptory, and authoritative manner alienates #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator, author, and protagonist of Black Like Me, and in some ways its only significant character, #X_0# is a middle-aged white Southerner with a passionate commitment to the cause of racial justice in the year 1959. In order to understand what life is like for black Americans, #X_0# undergoes medical therapy to darken his skin color, then poses as a black man for nearly two months. He publishes his experiences with prejudice and racism in the journal #Y_1#, leading to a firestorm of public controversy; he is eventually forced to move his family to #Y_0# to end the threat of violent reprisals from racist whites in his hometown in #Y_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The editor of a newspaper in a small #Y_1# town. Like #X_2#, #X_0# is a passionate advocate for racial equality in #Y_0#. #X_0#'s family is ostracized as a result of his stance, and his newspaper is a financial disaster. But he is an inspiration to #X_2#, who sees him as a sign of goodness flourishing amid the evil of racism and segregation.

-- #X_0# --
A soft-spoken, articulate black man who shines shoes for a living. #X_0# is #X_2#'s contact in the black society of #Y_0#, and first helps him make the transition from being a white man to being a black man.

-- #X_0# --
The dean of #Y_0#, which #X_1# visits during his stay with #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A well-dressed black man who rides on #X_2#'s bus during his trip through #Y_0#; #X_0# is fawning toward the white passengers, and cynical and condescending toward the blacks with whom he is forced to sit.

-- #X_0# --
The white photographer who photographs #X_1# in #Y_0#, coming to terms with his own social and racial preconceptions in the process.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist and the author of the novel. #X_0# is the novel's most fully developed character and also the one who changes the most within it. #X_0# starts the book as a cold and occasionally cruel character. He treats #X_2# and #X_1# with blunt rudeness. He ignores his very depressed sister, #X_3#, and it is his neglect, in part, that leads to her suicide. In the beginning of the novel, #X_0# acts only with self-interest, but after his experience of love he changes into a content, more generous creature, who is finally able to write a master novel.

-- #X_0# --
The very successful popular writer whom #X_1# is accused of killing at the end of the novel. #X_0# and #X_1#'s friendship is one of the primary relationships within the novel. Although #X_1# frequently dislikes #X_0#, #X_0# is portrayed very favorably. He is a polite, interesting man who always wants to know more about people's characters and who always longs to talk to them. He takes great pleasure in hearing about #X_2# Marloe's life, for example, while #X_1# at the same time is trying to get #X_2# out the door. #X_0#'s compassionate interest contrasts #X_1#'s coldness.

-- #X_0# --
The wife of #X_1# #X_0#. #X_0# is a forceful woman whom both #X_1# and #X_3# underestimate. #X_1# seems to think that all is well between him and his wife; #X_3# regards #X_0# as a benign, older woman. #X_0#'s firm speech and unforgiving tone, however, suggests the power within her personality, even if the other characters cannot see it. #X_0# herself predicts her fierceness when she tells #X_3# that she still has "real fire" in her. Despite #X_0#'s fierceness, she is also a sympathetic character who also helps to articulate the difficulties of being a middle-aged housewife.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of #X_1# and Rachel #X_0# and the person with whom #X_2# falls desperately in love. #X_0# is a youthful, naïve girl who frequently appears foolish. Because #X_2# Pearson is in love with her, and because he retells her story, her naïve nature is not always apparent and she occasionally comes across as sexually aggressive. Her naïveté however can be seen in her actions. For example, although she has broken up with her boyfriend just a week before, she decides that she is completely in love with #X_2# and that she wants to marry him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#'s brother and #X_2# Pearson's ex-brother-in-law. #X_0# is a comic character who exists for other characters and readers to laugh at. #X_0#'s comic nature comes from his pitiful physical condition and his constantly groveling behavior. Furthermore, the way that the other characters verbally abuse #X_0# provides comic effect, in a slapstick manner. #X_0# basically is a kind man who wants to treat other people kindly, but his constant fumbling makes it difficult to fully respect and sympathize with him. For example, #X_0# wants to help #X_5#, but leaves her for the whole night to go get drunk with #X_2#'s homosexual neighbor, during which time she kills herself. The foolishness of #X_0#'s behavior is characteristic of his way and is one of the reasons that he fits the role of the buffoon in the novel.

-- #X_0# --
The sister of #X_1# Pearson. #X_0# is a sympathetic, but pitiful woman who spends the majority of the book moaning about the ruined state of her life. #X_0#'s life, it appears, is somewhat ruined, since she spent most of it in an unloving marriage. Her painful experience testifies to the difficulties of life as well as the specific difficulties of being a woman. #X_0#'s great regret is the abortion that left her unable to have children. #X_0#'s sadness helps to establish #X_1#'s coldness as a character, because, despite her needs, he basically ignores her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# Pearson's ex-wife. #X_0# is a confident, strong woman who has aged but still remains sexually attractive. She has lived in #Y_0# for the past few years and appears slightly brassy and #Y_0#n. #X_0#'s character is seen entirely through her interaction with #X_2#, which is not entirely credible given his previous hatred of her. She, like #X_4#, is a woman of power, even though she has aged. #X_0# is a sympathetic and even admirable character, given the strength of her personality, but at the same time her brassy quality gives her a slightly comic edge.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#'s husband and #X_1# Pearson's brother-in-law. #X_1# always has disliked #X_0#'s chummy, non-intellectual style. #X_0# has done bad things in the past, namely having #X_4# have an abortion and then making her father pay for half of it. Her current affair with #X_3# in some ways also seems cruel since he is abandoning his wife, who cannot have children due to the abortion that #X_0# insisted upon. Still, while #X_0# has flaws, he is not all bad. Although #X_4# trick him into marrying her, he stayed with her for twenty years, despite their unhappiness. Furthermore, although he did have an affair, he kept it a secret until after she left him; then he asked for a divorce. Generally, the tendency to have an affair during marriage does not appear honorable, but since #X_0# and #X_4#'s marriage was so terrible, his actions actually seem understandable.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# Saxe's mistress who is pregnant with his child. Little is known about #X_0# except that she is a dentist. Her name suggests her freshness and youth. Her presence in #X_3#'s life testifies to the terrible state of his marriage. She and #X_3# also are a couple that mirror #X_1# and #X_2#, since #X_3# is significantly older that #X_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The editor of the novel. "#X_0#" is a pseudonym for #X_3#, the Greek god of the Arts. The prophetess #X_4# refers to #X_3# as "#X_0#" in #X_2#'s The Oresteia. #X_0# is not truly a developed character in the novel, as he only serves to provide a foreword and postscript. His primary role is to alert the readers to the primary theme of the book: the importance of art in articulating truth. Since #X_3# is the God of Arts, it seems appropriate that he is the one to supervise a novel that debates its relative merits.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_1#'s from work. Little is known about #X_0# except that #X_1# frequently has lunch with him and #X_2# later marries him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#'s ex-boyfriend. He never appears in the novel. At the end of the novel however, #X_4#'s name has changed to "#X_4# #X_0#" signifying that she has married him. His presence merely serves to suggest #X_4#'s youthful approach the art of loving, since it is just after breaking up with him that she decides that is passionately in love with #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator and protagonist. #X_0#, an orphan, becomes the housekeeper at #Y_0# when she, #X_1#, and #X_3# are taken in by Mr. #X_2#. Everyone loves #X_0#, who is selfless and nurturing, and she becomes the confidante of several young women. Although she eventually does find her mother, circumstances prevent them from developing a relationship. At first a hesitant, insecure narrator, #X_0#’s confidence in her storytelling grows, and she controls the narrative skillfully.

-- #X_0# --

When #X_2# is an adult, he proposes marriage, but he eventually rescinds his offer when he realizes she’s in love with someone else. #X_0# #X_0# has sworn off any involvement whatsoever with the #X_0# and #X_0# lawsuit.

-- #X_0# --
The Queen of #X_2#. #X_0# was praised for her moral insight and wisdom and known for her strength as a leader both in the palace and on the battlefield.

-- #X_0# --

She then tells of her first mystical visions of #X_1# and the ways her life changed afterward. #X_0# has an eventful life, full of travel, controversy, and confrontation. She travels across #Y_0#, as well as to #Y_2#, #Y_3#, #Y_4#, and #Y_1#—extraordinary for a middle-class woman of her time. Everywhere she goes, her ostentatious, highly emotional religiosity attracts attention, and her claims of receiving direct visions of #X_1# arouse suspicions of heresy. Her most important experiences, however, are all spiritual, and her narrative reflects #X_0#’s intense inward focus and her mystical raptures.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s husband. #X_0# is confused by #X_2#’s turn away from married life and toward religious devotion, and he shows both frustration and a great deal of patience with his rather demanding wife.

Eventually, #X_2# succeeds, and they take a vow of chastity.

He is at first rather loose-living, and his mother warns him often of the dangers of lust and “lechery.” #X_0# worry causes friction between them, but when the son becomes covered in sores and pustules, apparently due to a venereal complaint, he decides to mend his ways. #X_0# son eventually reforms, makes a trip to #Y_2#, and settles down with a German woman. After the birth of their first child, the couple comes to #Y_0# to visit #X_1#, but the son becomes sick and dies soon after.

-- #X_0# --
The German woman whom #X_0# son marries. #X_0# daughter-in-law stays with #X_1# for several months after the death of her husband.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_2#’s spiritual advisors and friends. Master #X_1# is a Carmelite Friar and an expert in mystical writings and theology. He befriends #X_2# soon after her mystical experiences begin and defends her when her unusual behavior begins to draw hostile notice. #X_2# learns much of the writings of such English mystics as #X_4# and #X_3#, as well as female precursors such as St. Bridget, thanks to Master #X_1#. Much later, Master #X_1#’s association with #X_2# gets him in trouble with his superiors in the church, and the two are forbidden to meet for a time. Before Master #X_1#’s death, however, the pair have a joyful reunion.

-- #X_0# --
The most important and powerful bishop in #Y_0#. #X_2# seeks an audience with the #X_0# on the advice of the Bishop of #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A friar, renowned for his preaching, who comes to live in #Y_0#. #X_1# looks forward to hearing the friar preach, but he is not used to being interrupted by loud wailing during his sermons. #X_0# other religious figures in #Y_0# try to get him to accept #X_1#’s eccentricities, but he cannot. He bans #X_1# from his church and sparks a backlash against #X_1# in #Y_0#, inspiring many who dislike her behavior to speak out against her.

-- #X_0# --
One of the greatest English mystics and best-known female writers of the Middle Ages. #X_0# was an anchoress (female hermit) in a convent in the city of #X_0#. The author of a book of her “revelations,” #X_0# was often sought out for guidance by political and religious authorities, as well as by common folk. #X_1# goes to pay her respects to #X_0# soon after her own mystical visions commence. The pair have a long conversation in which #X_0# tries to instruct #X_1# how to tell a true vision from a false one. #X_0# also tells #X_1# that her tears are a blessing and a sign of God’s favor.

-- #X_0# --
A priest who befriends #X_2# in #Y_0#. After #X_2# is kicked out of the English community in #Y_0#, she is taken in by several others, including a #X_0# priest who becomes her confessor. #X_0# priest advises #X_2# to give up her all-white wardrobe and care for a destitute Roman woman, and #X_2# obeys. Since the priest does not speak English and #X_2# does not speak #X_0#, the propriety of his acting as #X_2#’s spiritual advisor is suspect. At dinner one evening, however, #X_2# speaks to the #X_0# priest in English, and he translates her words into Latin for some English priests, who become convinced that God approves of the relationship.

-- #X_0# --
The priest who records #X_0# words, providing the text of the Book. This priest befriends #X_1# late in her life and agrees to help her tell her story. This is actually the second attempt to write down #X_0# life story. The first came several years before, when #X_1# made the attempt with an unnamed helper (very likely her son), and the result was a nearly illegible manuscript. The priest breaks into #X_0# story on occasion to verify her account or to back up her claims—for example, when #X_1# helps heal the young woman stricken, as #X_1# had been, with post-partum psychosis. The priest has a brief episode of trouble with his vision at the start of writing the Book, but he and #X_1# pray and his vision clears.

-- #X_0# --
A poor Irishman who aids #X_1# on her return from #Y_1#. Before #X_1# leaves on her pilgrimage to the Holy Land, her confessor prophesies that she will receive help from “a broken-backed man.” In #Y_3#, on her way home from #Y_1#, #X_1# is abandoned by her fellow pilgrims, but she meets #X_0#, who has a deformed spine. #X_1# immediately sees #X_0# as the “broken-backed” man of her confessor’s prophecy and hires him as an escort. #X_0# frequently seems bemused by his employer and is often afraid that they will attract bandits as they travel. In #Y_2#, #X_1# gives some of #X_0#’s money (which he has given her for safekeeping) to the poor, which annoys #X_0#. #X_1# promises to repay him, and does so when, by chance, she meets #X_0# again at #Y_0#, where #X_1# is setting off on her second pilgrimage abroad.

-- #X_0# --
A priest of #X_2#, and #X_0# primary spiritual advisor. In #X_0# visions, #X_1# instructs her several times to honor and obey the wisdom of Master #X_0#. Master #X_0# believes in #X_0# visions and defends her several times against those who would claim that her tears are fake or inspired by the devil rather than by God. Master #X_0# predicts that #X_3# will be helped on her pilgrimage by a “broken-backed man,” and the appearance of #X_4# in #Y_2# seems to fulfill his prophecy. #X_0# confessor helps her through many crises, including #X_0# difficulty with her enemy (the preaching friar) and the great fire that endangers the church in #X_2#. The greatest crisis in their relationship comes when #X_3# departs for #Y_0# with her daughter-in-law, after Master #X_0# has advised her to stay home. On her return, #X_3# apologizes humbly and is forgiven. #X_0# sense of profound gratitude toward her confessor is best expressed by her prayer to #X_1# that Master #X_0# have half of any blessing that #X_3# may receive in heaven.

-- #X_0# --
A priest of #Y_0#, well-known for his personal holiness and his great knowledge. The #X_0# befriends #X_1# and defends her from accusations of heresy. He asks for #X_1#’s prayers, and #X_1# is greatly moved to learn of his death.

When #X_1# is arrested near #X_0#, she is brought before the #X_0#, who questions her sharply about her tears. The #X_0# is soon convinced of #X_1#’s orthodoxy but is still concerned about the rumors he hears about her. In the end, the #X_0# simply tells her to leave town as soon as she can. When #X_1# is arrested again soon after, she is once more brought before the #X_0#. This time, the #X_0# seems more annoyed at #X_1#’s accusers, and he refuses to imprison her, despite the protestations of the men of #X_2#. The #X_0# appreciates #X_1#’s homespun wisdom—he is clearly amused by certain earthy stories #X_1# tells, although the stories are critical of priests. The #X_0# seems to grow to like #X_1# the more he sees of her, but as a busy administrator, he is glad to see the troublesome woman depart.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s stepmother. Unlike her husband, #X_0# first comes across as cold and impatient. The story reveals through her treatment of #X_2# and willingness to take in #X_3#, however, that beneath her tough exterior she is in fact kind and caring.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_3#’s secret lodger. When #X_0# comes to hide in the #X_3#s’, he is cautious and withdrawn. As he grows stronger, he reveals his tremendous rage towards #X_2#, which motivates him to stay alive no matter what. Of all the characters, he most understands #X_5#’s experience, and the two become not just friends but soul mates.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s best friend. With his blond hair, blue eyes, and athletic and intellectual talents, #X_0# is the physical embodiment of the perfect Aryan specimen, but he has surprising sensitivity and compassion. He is in love with #X_1# and is always there for her.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother’s sister. #X_0# finds herself in a disastrous marriage, though her father won’t allow her to divorce. Depressed and hopeless, #X_0# begins to take pills.

#X_1#’s three “best friends for life” from #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The son of the #X_2# and #X_3#, #X_0# is the only major character to have grown up outside of the World State. The consummate outsider, he has spent his life alienated from his village on the New Mexico Savage Reservation, and he finds himself similarly unable to fit into World State society. His entire worldview is based on his knowledge of #X_4#’s plays, which he can quote with great facility.

-- #X_0# --
An Alpha male who fails to fit in because of his inferior physical stature. He holds unorthodox beliefs about sexual relationships, sports, and community events. His insecurity about his size and status makes him discontented with #Y_0#. #X_0#’s surname recalls Karl #X_0#, the nineteenth-century German author best known for writing Capital, a monumental critique of capitalist society. Unlike his famous namesake, #X_0#’s discontent stems from his frustrated desire to fit into his own society, rather than from a systematic or philosophical criticism of it. When threatened, #X_0# can be petty and cruel.

-- #X_0# --
An Alpha lecturer at #Y_0#, #X_0# is a prime example of his caste, but feels that his work is empty and meaningless and would like to use his writing abilities for something more meaningful. He and #X_1# are friends because they find common ground in their discontent with #Y_1#, but #X_0#’s criticisms of #Y_1# are more philosophical and intellectual than #X_1#’s more petty complaints. As a result, #X_0# often finds #X_1#’s boastfulness and cowardice tedious.

-- #X_0# --
A vaccination worker at #Y_1#. She is an object of desire for a number of major and minor characters, including #X_1# Marx and #X_3#. Her behavior is sometimes intriguingly unorthodox, which makes her attractive to the reader. For example, she defies her culture’s conventions by dating one man exclusively for several months, she is attracted to #X_1#—the misfit—and she develops a violent passion for #X_3# the Savage. Ultimately, her values are those of a conventional #Y_0# citizen: her primary means of relating to other people is through sex, and she is unable to share #X_1#’s disaffection or to comprehend #X_3#’s alternate system of values.

-- #X_0# --
The Resident World Controller of Western Europe, one of only ten World Controllers. He was once an ambitious, young scientist performing illicit research. When his work was discovered, he was given the choice of going into exile or training to become a World Controller. He chose to give up science, and now he censors scientific discoveries and exiles people for unorthodox beliefs. He also keeps a collection of forbidden literature in his safe, including #X_1# and religious writings. The name #X_0# means “world,” and #X_0# is indeed the most powerful character in the world of this novel.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# #X_0#’s friend (they have the same last name because only about ten thousand last names are in use in #Y_0#). #X_0#’s role is mainly to voice the conventional values of her caste and society. Specifically, she warns #X_1# that she should have more men in her life because it looks bad to concentrate on one man for too long.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_2#’s many lovers, he is a perfectly conventional Alpha male, casually discussing #X_2#’s body with his coworkers. His success with #X_2#, and his casual attitude about it, infuriate the jealous #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother, and a Beta. While visiting the New Mexico Savage Reservation, she became pregnant with the Director’s son. During a storm, she got lost, suffered a head injury, and was left behind. A group of Indians found her and brought her to their village. #X_0# could not get an abortion on the Reservation, and she was too ashamed to return to the #Y_0# with a baby. Her #Y_0#–conditioned promiscuity makes her a social outcast. She is desperate to return to the #Y_0# and to soma.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# administrates #Y_1#. He is a threatening figure, with the power to exile #X_1# to #Y_0#. But he is secretly vulnerable because he fathered a child (#X_2#), a scandalous and obscene act in #Y_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the secular, shallow equivalent of an archbishop in the #Y_0# society.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# was #X_1#’s lover on the New Mexico Savage Reservation. He gave #X_1# a copy of The Complete Works of Shakespeare.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the talkative chief administrator for #Y_0#. He is an Alpha.

-- #X_0# --
The youngest #X_0# daughter and narrator of Bread Givers. The most fiercely independent of Reb #X_0#’s daughters, #X_0# wants more than any of them to create a life of her own. Though she admires her father’s dedication and inner flame, she is also deeply resentful of his hypocrisy and the chances he has denied all his daughters. She develops crushes on men with similar dedication and fire, seeking a more willing and understanding role model than Reb #X_0#, as well as a companion who will acknowledge and appreciate the identity she’s struggled to build. #X_0# is willing to work hard to get what she wants, but her ceaseless craving for companionship and tendency to romanticize her situation sometimes distract her from her ultimate goal.

-- #X_0# --
The head of the #X_0# family and #X_1#’s major antagonist. Extremely dedicated in his religious beliefs, #X_0# has devoted his entire life to studying the Torah and other Jewish holy books. The spirit he gathers from these studies fills him with a holy light that leaves others in awe but causes family problems when #X_0# confuses this spiritual knowledge with more worldly wisdom. His innocence often leads him to make foolish decisions that he refuses to acknowledge, insisting that a man as learned as he could never make such mistakes. After his wife dies, he remarries quickly and forces his daughters to remain with him as long as possible because he knows he needs someone to take care of him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s mother and Reb #X_0#’s long-suffering wife. #X_0# is truly in awe of her husband’s holiness, though she complains bitterly about the poverty it forces on her. She also feels protective of her husband—he lives so much in his own world that it’s hard for him to function in the real one. She firmly believes a woman’s highest aspiration is to be a wife and mother, and despite her husband’s manipulations, she genuinely wishes to see her daughters settled into good marriages. Though she doesn’t understand why #X_2# desires a different route, she loves her enough to support her in the best way she can.

-- #X_0# --
The oldest #X_0# daughter. #X_0# is the major financial support for the family, and even at a young age she is worn out from constant stress and work. She despises her father for using up all her good years for himself but is afraid to leave because providing for others is the only life she knows. Resentful of her status as an old maid, #X_0# finds joy in her eventual marriage to #X_3# only because of the affection that her youngest stepson, #X_2#, feels for her. The only reason #X_0# agrees to marry #X_3# is that #X_2# needs her.

-- #X_0# --
One of the middle #X_0# daughters. #X_0# is extremely beautiful, and the rest of the family thinks she is vain. In fact, #X_0# needs beauty to sustain her, and her own looks, as well as the music in the park, are the only resources she has. She falls in love with the music #X_1# Novak makes before she even sees #X_1# himself, and when he breaks her heart, he destroys her hope of finding any more beauty in the world. She wastes away to a worn, quiet shadow of her former self, and hints of her former spirit show only in her enjoyment of her children and the cleanliness of her small house.

-- #X_0# --
One of the middle #X_0# daughters. Comfortable with speaking her mind, #X_0# goes further than either #X_1# or #X_2# in defending her sweetheart. However, #X_0# is also more practical than her sisters and attempts to make her father’s choice of husband work for her. Ultimately unsuccessful, she complains bitterly about her marriage at every opportunity and, though she frequently derides #X_3#’s accomplishments, appears jealous of her sisters, as well. Though she lives across the country, #X_0# keeps in regular contact with her mother and sisters.

-- #X_0# --
The clothing cutter with whom #X_1# falls in love. An ambitious young man who plans to open his own shop, #X_0# wants to marry #X_1# because she’s a sensible, competent girl who would be a great help in running his business. Somewhat sporadic in his religious observance, #X_0# thinks anyone who clings to the old ways is crazy and has no patience for anyone who attempts to make him follow those ways.

-- #X_0# --
The school principal with whom #X_2# falls in love. An intelligent, well-respected man, #X_0# is filled with the knowledge that #X_2# longs for and admires. A kind man who treats everyone with respect, #X_0# puts far more value on his personal observations about people than on what others might say about them. #X_0# still feels a great bond with the old country and the customs he was raised with, and he holds #X_1# learning in awe.

-- #X_0# --
The poet with whom #X_1# falls in love. A pale young man with a shabby coat and a desperate need for a haircut, #X_0# believes strongly in the power of both love and poetry. When #X_2# forces #X_1# away from him, however, he becomes bitter enough to crush #X_3# when she comes to him with her own dreams. #X_0# earns a living writing for newspapers and spends his free time at the library.

-- #X_0# --
The piano player with whom #X_1# falls in love. The son of wealthy parents, #X_0# has grown up with money but doesn’t share his father’s prejudice against those who haven’t. Though he cares deeply for #X_1#, #X_0# loves music more than anything else and will temporarily sacrifice even #X_1# in order to continue performing it.

-- #X_0# --
The diamond dealer #X_2# chooses to be #X_1#’s husband. A charming and generous man on the surface, #X_0# is in fact a calculating liar who will say anything to get what he wants. Unable to hold down a regular job, he emotionally abuses #X_1# and thinks nothing of dining out and wearing fancy clothes while his wife and children starve.

-- #X_0# --
The fish peddler #X_2# chooses to be #X_1#’s husband. A basically honest man who desperately needs help caring for his children, #X_0# genuinely means to give #X_1# everything he promises her during their courtship. However, he is too conservative to bother finding out what might actually win her over—one of many concerns he feels is too “Americanized.”

-- #X_0# --
The cloaks-and-suits dealer #X_2# chooses to be #X_1#’s husband. #X_0# substitutes expensive presents for genuine affection or attention, both during courtship and after he and #X_1# return to #Y_0#. A compulsive gambler, #X_0# uses his wife’s appearance to show the world how affluent he is.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s partner, who comes to #Y_0# to court #X_3#. A self-made businessman who is derisive of the education he never had, #X_0# is completely focused on money, possessions, and potential profit. During his time with #X_3#, he flaunts his wealth and worldliness instead of showing any interest in her needs.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# second wife. Originally a widow who lived above the #X_2#’ place, #X_0# pretends to be a supportive woman but truthfully cares only about financial gain. She feels life owes her a certain amount of wealth, and when she doesn’t get it, she takes vengeance on everyone around her.

-- #X_0# --
The story's first-person narrator and its principal protagonist. #X_0#is #X_6#'s daughter, #X_1#'s charge, #X_4# granddaughter, #X_5#'s wife and #X_2#'s mother. A child of rape, #X_0#is raised in #Y_0#, #Y_1#, by her maternal aunt #X_1# before being called to #Y_2# by her mother at the age of twelve. Notably, #X_0#does not look like her mother, her face reflecting the unseen face of #X_6#'s attacker. As the child of a poor immigrant in #Y_2#, #X_0#must take on the full weight of her mother's and aunt's dreams, spending six years doing nothing but studying and attending church. She must also contend with her mother's trauma, insomnia and nightmares, and with her own conflicting roles as independent woman, loving daughter, savior from nightmares, and reminder of the past. As an adult, #X_0#'s insomnia, bulimia and sexual phobia echo her mother's own problems and insecurities, even as her loyalty, love, determination and strength reflect her mother's, aunt's and grandmother's spirit. Yet #X_0#'s relentless and honest examination of herself and her inheritance has perhaps paid off: her daughter, #X_2#, is strong and implacable, suggesting both #X_3# courage and a break with the more destructive patterns of her maternal line.

-- #X_0# --
#X_7#'s maternal aunt and first guardian, #X_6#'s sister and #X_2#'s daughter. #X_0# is devastated by two great betrayals: in her youth, #X_1# promises to marry her and then suddenly marries another woman, and in her old age, #X_0#'s best friend, #X_4#, leaves for #Y_0# without so much as a goodbye. She is a character of great perseverance, faithfully caring for #X_7# at the novel's beginning and for #X_2# at the novel's end. Yet as the novel progresses, she becomes understandably bitter at a world that has given her all the restraints of being a poor woman, a daughter, and a virgin, with none of its rewards. Illiterate for much of #X_7#'s childhood, #X_0# is taught to read by #X_4# shortly before the latter's unceremonious departure. Bound to Dame #X_5# by duty to her mother, #X_0# refuses to join #X_6# in #Y_1# and instead turns increasingly to alcohol. Throughout, #X_0# remains deeply loyal to #X_6# and to her mother, and loves #X_7# greatly. #X_7#, the beloved child, remains one of #X_0#'s few consolations against the cruel and indifferent march of fate.

-- #X_0# --
#X_5#'s mother, #X_1#'s sister and #X_2# daughter. #X_0#was raped at the age of sixteen by a masked #X_3# in a cane field on her way home from school. The rape left #X_0#with a child, #X_5#, and a lifetime of vivid nightmares. #X_0#'s emigration to #Y_1# after #X_5#'s birth, where she works tirelessly at menial jobs, has meant some precious money for the family. It has also meant #X_5#'s chance to leave #Y_0# and to get an American education, a chance that #X_0#invests with all the power of what has been denied her. #X_0#'s continual struggle to be a good mother to #X_5# and a sexually adequate lover to #X_4# remain powerfully informed by the twin violations of rape and of her own mother's practice of testing for virginity. She is a deeply loving and deeply wounded character, hoping to show her daughter a way beyond her own life even though she cannot help but perpetuate some of its troubles.

-- #X_0# --
The matriarch of the #X_2# family. #X_0#lives alone in the remote village of La Nouvelle #Y_0#, #Y_1#, until #X_7# leaves for #Y_3# and #X_1# comes to #Y_0# to be with her out of duty. She is wise, candid, practical and astute, with an intuitive knowledge of human nature and a bottomless reserve of parables. Yet she is also necessarily a product of her world, content with her provincial village and accepting of its customs and order. In #X_6#'s and #X_1#'s youth, #X_0#tested her daughters' virginity in keeping with what she perceived as a mother's duty, despite the tremendous pain it caused them. Later, seeing the #X_5# begin to beat a coal-seller in the marketplace, #X_0# #X_0#'s first thought is to hurry #X_7# home. But while she does not consider it her place to challenge the social order, #X_0#is intensely loyal to her children, loving them against all of the world's pain so that a granddaughter or great-granddaughter can see her way out from under the burden.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s first and only boyfriend and eventual husband. #X_0#is a professional musician who lives next door to the house where #X_2# and #X_1# move during #X_2#'s eighteenth year. He is an African-American from #Y_0# and can speak a form of Creole, giving him an immediate kinship with #X_2#. Though old enough to be #X_2#'s father, #X_0#is honest, gentle, loving and sure, in stark contrast to the violence, sleaziness and treachery of many of the novel's men. He is deeply supportive of #X_2#, committed to helping her as best he can, and enormously proud of their infant daughter.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s long-time lover in #Y_0#. #X_0#is a stocky, well-dressed Haitian lawyer, in love with his mother's cooking and by his own full name, #X_0#Jolibois Francis Legrand Moravien Chevalier (the last word meaning knight). He is slightly patronizing of #X_3# and treats her as a child throughout the book. He is kind to #X_2#, though he does not deeply understand her, as symbolized by his ability to sleep like a log during most of her nightmares. Though his affection for #X_2# seems genuine, he retains the slightly sleazy air of one too well-connected, a lawyer intent on evading blame.

-- #X_0# --
A relatively affluent and handsome neighbor of #X_2#'s and Tante #X_1#'s in #Y_0#, #Y_1#. Though once in love with #X_1#, he married another woman, a betrayal from which #X_1# has never recovered. His post as teacher at the local school distinguishes him in the community as a man with a profession.

-- #X_0# --
Wife of #X_3# #X_0#. #X_5# is a pretty, gossipy and self-important woman whom #X_3# chose to marry, breaking his engagement with #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s daughter by #X_2#. The infant #X_0#has a remarkable face in which #X_1# can see the traces of generations of ancestors. She is calm, quiet and sleeps peacefully, signs that perhaps she has not inherited the insomnia and nightmares of her mother and grandmother.

-- #X_0# --
A vendor in the marketplace of La Nouvelle #Y_1#. #X_0#becomes Tante #X_1#'s best friend once #X_1# returns to #Y_1# from #Y_0# to take care of the aging #X_2#. Though #X_0#teaches the adult #X_1# to read and write, she remains a troubling influence, implicated in #X_1#'s night wanderings and her increasing alcoholism. #X_0#'s dream is to save enough money to take a boat to #Y_3#, despite the great risks of the journey. She appears as a deeply desperate woman, continually seeking a buyer for her pig in order to raise the money for her trip. When #X_2#, fed up with #X_0#'s effect on #X_1#, finally buys #X_0#'s pig, #X_0#departs without so much as a goodbye to #X_1#, leaving #X_1# heartbroken for a second time.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s therapist and the instigator of the sexual phobia group. #X_0#is a gorgeous black woman who wears bangles and bright prints and smokes as she theorizes. She has spent two years in #Y_2# in #Y_1# and is an initiated #Y_0# priestess.

-- #X_0# --
Creole for "Uncle Bogeyman." Refers to the private militia first conscripted under #X_1#, Haitian president from 1957–1971, and formally known as the VSN (#Y_1#). #X_0#y are widely feared as torturers, assassins and agents of arbitrary cruelty.

-- #X_0# --
The poor coal seller in the marketplace of #Y_1#. #X_0#is capriciously beaten and finally killed by Macoute soldiers during #X_4#'s trip to #Y_0# with her infant daughter in #Y_2#. His name suggests the General #X_0#, born a slave, who fought with Toussaint #X_2# against the French to establish an independent #Y_0#. When #X_2# was arrested by the French in 1802, #X_0#became the revolution's leader, winning a decisive battle at #Y_3# against #X_3#'s armies, declaring #Y_0# an independent state in 1804 and ruling it until his assasination in 1806. Though he was by no means an unproblematic figure, #X_0#is widely remembered as the father of #Y_0#an independence. The ironic coincidence of the coalseller's name indicates the extent to which the current government has oppressed the #Y_0#an people.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator and protagonist of the story, an architectural artist turned disillusioned army captain. As he begins his time at #Y_2#, #X_0# seeks out “love,” something that his sensible friends in his first term can’t provide him. In meeting #X_3#, he discovers a world of profound beauty, tied to #X_3#’s ancestral home at #Y_0# Castle. After he loses #X_3# to drinking, #X_0# begins a passionate affair with #X_1#, attracted as much to her tie to #Y_0# as to her. Eventually, #X_0# realizes that the #X_2# family’s Catholicism has been what his life has spiritually lacked.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s first love, an exuberant and decadent young aristocrat. #X_0# has good looks and a charming, magnetic personality that makes him instantly likeable. However, his joyful exuberance is marred by a deep childishness. #X_0# dreads growing up, as symbolized by his attachment to his teddy bear, Aloysius. He eventually trades his teddy bear for alcohol, leading to an addiction that drives him away from #X_2# and destroys his life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s second love, #X_4#’s sister. Although she and #X_4# look very similar, #X_0# cares deeply about public opinion. She approaches marriage by seeking a match based on social standing and not considering the reality of the long-term commitment, and she abandons her Catholicism to marry #X_3#. She becomes haunted by this choice, believing herself irredeemable. However, when she sees her father repent on his deathbed, she realizes that she has not strayed too far from God to return.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s younger sister, a clever and devout Catholic. #X_0# is a joyful child, willful and exuberant. As she matures, her Catholic faith deepens, and she often provides a voice of spiritual reason. She wishes to become a nun, but unable to do so, she volunteers to provide medical relief in conflict zones. Although she never marries, she has a deep and constant love for her family and those she cares about.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# and #X_1#’s friend, an eccentric and decadent European aesthete. #X_1# disapproves of the way #X_0# goes out of his way to flaunt his unconventional behavior, as if he simply enjoys getting a reaction out of others. #X_0# disdains English “charm,” or manners, which he deems unsophisticated and insipid. He tries to convince #X_1# to abandon charm in favor of his more Bohemian lifestyle.

-- #X_0# --
Sebastian’s older brother and heir to #X_0# Castle. #X_1# is a serious, philosophical man who seems older than his years. #X_1# has a scholarly bent and considers joining the Jesuits, a scholarly branch of #Y_1#. However, #X_1# spends so much time analyzing Catholic doctrine that he ignores the spirit, causing him to lack purpose or direction in life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#’s father, a melancholic and #X_3# man. #X_0# #X_0# abandons Lady #X_0# after his service in World War I, causing scandal. He resents that Lady #X_0# won’t grant him a divorce because of her Catholic faith. Like #X_4#, #X_0# #X_0# has a childish selfishness, and he wishes to live his decadent life without consequence. His anger at Lady #X_0# causes him to abandon society. Nevertheless, he finds redemption on his deathbed when he makes the sign of the cross to the priest.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother, an overbearing but caring woman. #X_0# #X_0# tries to use her considerable influence to fix problems in her children’s lives, causing resentment. Although #X_1# and Lord #X_0# resent her unshakable values, her heart is in the right place and her judgement sound.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s husband, a Canadian immigrant and politician. #X_0# achieves political success because of his ability to ingratiate himself to others, but, as #X_1# and #X_2# observe, his “yes-man” mentality also causes him to lack a self of his own. As a result, he approaches commitments, like marriage, without serious intent.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s wife and #X_3#’s sister, a charming but shallow society woman. #X_0# is an adept and savvy hostess and uses her talent to further her and #X_1#’s connections and support #X_1#’s artistic career. Although she cheats on #X_1#, she becomes incensed when #X_1# begins a public affair with #X_2#, valuing the appearance of a happy marriage over the reality.

-- #X_0# --
Lord #X_2#’s mistress, an insightful and wise woman. #X_0# has a deep understanding of Lord #X_2#’s personality and stays with him despite having no illusion that their relationship is built on true love. She offers #X_1# a prescient assessment of #X_3#’s character.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s father, an eccentric and rude man. After #X_1#’s mother’s death, #X_0# becomes a recluse, actively driving family away. He possesses an indirect way of expressing himself, often attempting to annoy others until they leave him alone.

-- #X_0# --
An #Y_0# history don who wins favor with Lady #X_2#. Insincere and pompous, #X_0# uses Lady #X_2#’s money to further his research. #X_1# observes that #X_0# cares more about the appearance of knowledge than its substance.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s companion in #Y_0#, a young German man. Lazy and needy, #X_0# shoots himself in the foot to secure his discharge from #Y_1#. He relies on #X_1# for care and money, clearly taking advantage of him. However, #X_0# also fulfills #X_1#’s desire to care for someone.

-- #X_0# --
A new platoon commander in #X_1#’s unit. #X_1# thinks of him as an emblem of modern #Y_0#. #X_0# values money and efficiency over honor and legacy, displaying a callous attitude toward human life and disparaging tradition.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s cousin, a serious student who wishes to guide #X_1# through the social politics of #Y_0#. He is exasperated by #X_1#’s bad conduct because it reflects badly on #X_0#’s social standing.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s fiancé, a middle-class Catholic widow. Rude and after #X_2#’s money, she exaggerates her Catholic faith to impress him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s first friend at #Y_0#, a grave and studious young man. He cares deeply about the theory behind things but doesn’t appear touched by their spirit.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s Commanding Officer, an impatient and rude man focused entirely on proper appearances despite his unit’s lack of actual meaningful work to accomplish.

-- #X_0# --
The head servant of the #X_2# household.

-- #X_0# --
Lord #X_1#’s faithful valet.

-- #X_0# --
The main character and protagonist of the novel. #X_3# is a fifth-grader living in a rural Southern area. He is lonely and lost in the middle of a family of four girls when #X_4# Burke moves in next door. #X_4# and #X_3# become best friends, and the novel centers on their friendship. #X_3# is a budding artist whose talent receives little praise from anyone except #X_4# and Miss #X_2#. Yet he is quite talented, as well as intelligent, caring, and down- to-earth. A thoroughly likable character, we are quickly drawn into his world and his personal tribulations.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s new next-door neighbor and best friend. Highly intelligent and imaginative, it is her idea to build a fantasyland named Terabithia across the creek. #X_0#'s family is affluent and well educated, in stark contrast with the rest of the residents in the area, and has an entirely different slant on life than any of the neighbors. All this influences #X_0# as well and helps to develop her uniqueness and distinct flair.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s mother. #X_0#is tired and careworn with the stresses of trying to support a family of seven on a poor family's income. She always seems to be hounding #X_1# to do chores or milk the cow, but her shortness of temper is merely a result of overwork. After #X_2#'s death, she shows herself to be a caring mother torn apart by her son's pain. Nevertheless, under normal circumstances she does not help to make #X_1#'s home life inviting or comfortable.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s father. #X_0#is likewise harried by the concerns of being the sole breadwinner for a large family. He rarely has time for #X_1#, which is hard on the boy. He wants to do the right thing by his son, but he isn't quite sure how; the irony is that all he would really need to do would be to sit down with #X_1#, ruffle his hair, and talk with him about his day, but he doesn't seem to understand this. He expects #X_1# to be a "man," a source of considerable heartache and soul-searching on the part of #X_1#, whose passions lie elsewhere than playing football and driving big trucks. However, he is concerned with his son's welfare and wants nothing but the best for him, as is evidenced in his treatment of #X_1# after #X_2#'s death.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s oldest sister. Her age is never given directly, but we can guess that she's about fifteen or sixteen. #X_0# is thoroughly spoiled, much like #X_1#, the difference between them is that #X_0# has mastered the art of sycophancy, and consequently leaves a much better taste in most people's mouths. Vain, conceited, and shallow, #X_0# continually annoys #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s second-oldest sister. We can surmise that she is around fourteen. #X_0# is even more annoying than #X_1#. She shares #X_1#'s vanity and shallowness, but she whines continually and has no sense of when to stop before pushing people too far. She harries #X_2# continually, and is primly content with her own little world of makeup, scanty clothing, and romantic interests. Even after #X_3#'s death, #X_0# will not stop harassing #X_2#. She is wholly immature and self-absorbed.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s little sister. #X_0# #X_0# is closer to him than any other member of their family. She is six and a bit lost, and she is without close friends or siblings close enough in age to play with. She often tries to push herself in with #X_2# and #X_3#, which they do not like, but all the same #X_2# feels bad for her. At the end of the novel, it is she who allows #Y_0# to live on, as she becomes its new queen.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s youngest sister, at four years old. #X_0# is not developed very much as a character. She is often portrayed as whiny, but she is only four. #X_1# does not share the same bond with her that he does with #X_2#, but he seems to feel a certain warmth toward her, as is evidenced by the end of the book, when he suggests that in time, #X_0# may join #X_2# in Terabithia as a princess.

-- #X_0# --
The music teacher at the school. #X_2# is deeply in puppy love with her. She seems a creature from another world to him, a beautiful woman with a beautiful look and a smile for all the students, but especially #X_2#. She encourages his artistic talent, one of the two people in the world, including #X_3#, who does, and seems to care about him in a special way. She is somewhat of a hippie, which only deepens her allure for #X_2#, because it confirms her individuality and separation from the narrow world of Lark Creek. Kind and caring, it is no mystery why #X_2# adores her, as she seems to fill a void of affection and compassion that he does not get from his family.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s father. He is a political writer who is extremely gifted intellectually but rather scatterbrained. #X_3#'s growing friendship with #X_1# disturbs #X_2# until #X_3# invites him to spend time with them as well.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s mother. #X_2# writes novels and seems to spend most of her time closed in her room with her typewriter going. Not that she neglects #X_3#, but she just seems busier than Mr. #X_0#. All in all, #X_3#'s parents lavish on her the love and attention that is not demonstrated clearly in #X_1#'s house.

-- #X_0# --
A seventh-grader who is the school bully. #X_0# terrorizes #X_3#, as well as the rest of the younger kids, until #X_1# and #X_2# find a way of getting back at her. However, #X_0# is not an ultimate demon; she has her own problems that lend her an aspect of sympathy. Her father abuses her, and when her friends blab her secrets to the entire school, her tough-girl persona snaps. It is #X_2# who comforts her, at #X_1#'s urging, forming an unlikely friendship between them.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator. #X_0# is a Dominican immigrant living in #Y_0# who recounts the story of #X_3# and the de León/Cabral family. #X_0# first met #X_3# at #Y_1#, where the two became roommates. #X_0# initially showed #X_3# kindness in an attempt to court #X_3#’s sister, #X_2#. Eventually, they became friends, and #X_0# felt protective of #X_3#. As a narrator, #X_0# has a distinctive voice that ranges from crass and irreverent to serious and sophisticated. His language also frequently incorporates English and Hispanic slang as well as Spanish words and phrases.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist. Nicknamed “#X_0# Wao,” the novel’s protagonist is an overweight Dominican boy who grew up in #Y_1#, #Y_0#. #X_0# had a bookish sensibility from a young age. As an adolescent he #X_0#veloped a hardcore enthusiasm for science fiction and fantasy and nurtured an ambition to write his own genre fiction and become “the Dominican #X_3#.” #X_0# spent much of his short life hopelessly in love with women but afraid that no woman would ever reciprocate his love. Feelings of rejection periodically sent him into spirals of severe #X_0#pression.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s ol#X_0#r sister. From an early age, #X_0# proved to be tough and in#X_0#pen#X_0#nt. Her tomboyish behavior resulted in a complicated relationship with her mother that grew increasingly antagonistic during her teenage years. Despite the tension at home, #X_0# felt #X_0#eply protective of #X_2#. She had a long-term relationship with #X_3#, and she narrates two short sections of the book.

-- #X_0# --
#X_6# and #X_5#’s mother. Known as #X_2#, she was born to the respectable but doomed #X_3# family. #X_2# never knew her parents. She grew up in the care of her father’s cousin #X_4#. #X_2#’s fiercely in#X_0#pen#X_0#nt personality got her into trouble with a Dominican gangster. After getting beaten nearly to #X_0#ath, #X_2# left #Y_1# for #Y_0#. A man she met on the plane fathered her two children then left them. #X_2# worked two to three jobs at a time, and she had an antagonistic relationship with her children.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father. #X_0# was a prominent surgeon who received his medical training in #Y_0#. He and his family fell from grace when he made an off-color joke that allegedly insulted #X_3#. The dictator had #X_0# tortured and imprisoned for the rest of his life. According to #X_4#’s account, #X_0#’s imprisonment initiated the curse, or fukú, on the #X_0# family.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s mother. #X_0# was a beautiful woman and a gifted nurse practitioner who ran a respectable clinic with her husband. Though skilled at her work and undaunted by medical emergencies, her husband’s arrest and imprisonment broke her. Soon after giving birth to her third daughter, #X_2#, #X_0# committed suicide by jumping in front of a train.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# and #X_2#’s grandmother. Though #X_3# and #X_2# refer to #X_0# as their “abuela,” or grandmother, she was technically #X_1#’s father’s cousin, and she took #X_1# in after the girl’s father was imprisoned and her mother committed suicide. Even after #X_1# left #Y_1#, #X_0# remained an important figure in her life and in the lives of her children.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s final love interest. #X_2# fell in love with #X_0# during the summer he spent in #Y_1# with his family. About ten years older than #X_2# and an alcoholic, #X_0# was a “semiretired” prostitute who lived two houses down from #Y_0#. Though #X_0# reciprocated #X_2#’s feelings, her relationship with an abusive police officer put a violent end to her affair with #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s other lover. #X_0# was a Dominican police officer who occasionally sought #X_2#’s services. He grew intensely jealous when he learned about #X_1#, and he ordered his cronies to take #X_1# out to the cane fields and beat him. #X_0# coerced #X_2# into marrying him, and when #X_1# returned to #Y_0#, he had #X_1# killed.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s first love. Known only as “the #X_0#” in the novel, this man was a criminal who had ties to the #X_2# regime. His parents had kicked him out of the house at age seven. Soon thereafter, he fell in with a rough crowd, and he made his first contract kill at fourteen. #X_1# met him at a club called #Y_0#, and he pursued her romantically. She fell in love with him, and he promised to marry her. Eventually, she learned he was already married to #X_2#’s sister, a fact that led to a near-fatal attack on #X_1#’s life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# and #X_1#’s uncle. After his final round of incarceration, #X_0# came to live with #X_2#’s family in #Y_0#. He had a voracious sexual appetite and a heroin addiction.

-- #X_0# --

To English-speaking readers, the names of the characters in The Brothers #X_5# can be confusing. Characters are often referred to formally, with both their first and middle names: “#X_3#” or “#X_2#.” In these cases, the middle names are almost always based on the name of the character’s father. #X_0#s a result, the #X_5# brothers all have the middle name “Fyodorovich,” meaning literally, “son of Fyodor.” We learn very little about the father of #X_5#’s first wife, #X_0#delaida #X_4#ovna, but from her middle name, we know that his name was #X_4#. Keeping this device in mind can be a helpful way to distinguish the characters early in the novel when a character’s father also takes part in the story.

(Vanya, Vanka, Vanechka) The second son of Fyodor Pavlovich #X_0#, and the middle brother between Dmitri and #X_2#. A brilliant student, #X_0# has an acutely logical mind and demands a rational explanation for everything that happens in the universe. As a result of his inability to reconcile the idea of unjust suffering with the idea of a loving God, #X_0# is plagued by religious doubt, and he oscillates between outright atheism and belief in a malevolent God. His forceful arguments about God’s cruelty toward mankind are compelling, but after they lead to the murder of his father, they drive him into madness.

Because of his naiveté, #X_0# is taken in by #X_1#'s constant complaining against the captain, and is perhaps falsely convinced of #X_2#'s madness.

-- #X_0# --
A young, ambitious, self-described "bookman," he presents one of the great mysteries of The Caine Mutiny. He acts stubbornly, rashly, and harshly in many circumstances, but the whether the symptoms actually add up to a clinical case of paranoia, as his men claim, is not clear. One of the most interesting sociological phenomena in the book is the "circle of compliance," that forms around #X_0#, in which is extravagant orders are performed to perfection within the circle, and utterly ignored outside it.

-- #X_0# --
The first captain of the Caine under whom #X_3# serves, he is probably the best captain to command the ship. With only an abbreviated understanding of how the #Y_0# and ships like the Caine run, he emphasizes performance, not appearance. He makes a very accurate assessment of #X_3# to #X_2# early in the book, saying that though #X_3# needs conditioning, he will turn into a competent officer. #X_0# #X_0# is well liked by the crew, who present him with a silver watch upon his departure from the ship.

-- #X_0# --
A hotshot #Y_1# lawyer in peacetime, this Jewish fighter pilot is pressured into defending #X_2# and the rest of the #X_1# mutineers. #X_0# is an exceptionally gifted speaker, and very persuasive. Against his beliefs, he gets #X_2# acquitted, but then reprimands the crew for their attack on the #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# Wynn's agent, he is a wholehearted supporter and friend to #X_1# and #X_3#, although #X_3# suspects him of having an affair with #X_1#. #X_0# sets #X_1# up with the jobs that allow her to support her family, he finds an apartment she can afford, and in the end, he helps #X_3# find #X_1# when she does not want to be found.

-- #X_0# --
A loyal senior officer through the reigns of #X_2# and #X_3#, he greets #X_5# with these prophetic words: "You don't know what you're jumping into." When #X_0#t receives orders to leave the #X_1#, he is the envy of the ship.

-- #X_0# --
The African American steward's mate on the Caine, this enlisted sailor must provide coffee for the officers whenever they want it and prepare the meals. The crew appreciate his services, but many still discriminate against #X_0# because of his race.

-- #X_0# --
An ensign on the Caine, he is #X_1#'s first friend aboard ship. Their bond is solidified when #X_1# gives his hat to #X_0#to vomit into atop the crow's nest. #X_0#is married, and views the war differently than #X_1# does because of his attachments.

-- #X_0# --
As executive officer to Captain #X_1#, he is friendly and easygoing with the crew, but maintains the authority needed to perform his duties. When #X_2# takes over, #X_0# reacts by changing his command style to match the captain's desire for discipline.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#, known to the crew only as #X_0#, is the only person to die onboard the Caine during its many voyages. His unfortunate demise reminds #X_2# of the inevitability of death.

-- #X_0# --
Creator of much controversy on the #X_1#, he is #X_2#'s unfortunate scapegoat. #X_2#'s inhumane treatment of #X_0# is what clinches #X_3#'s opinion that the captain is a monster. #X_0# chooses to risk his military career in order to save his marriage.

-- #X_0# --
A pudgy but good-humored sailor, he illustrates the typical role of the drafted sailor. He shows an uncanny understanding of the problems with the captain, and eventually looks up to #X_1# as a voice of reason and confirmation among the officers.

-- #X_0# --
As judge advocate in #X_3# trial, it is his job to prosecute the mutineer. #X_0# thinks that #X_2#'s case is a plain and simple one of allowing the psychologists to prove #X_2# sane. He is very distraught when #X_1#'s tricks cause a probable miscarriage of justice.

-- #X_0# --
The son of the owner of an east coast shipyard, he is a spoiled brat who shows what #X_2# could have been in the #Y_0#. #X_1# avoids the danger of war and arranges a safe career, just as #X_2# could have and did not.

-- #X_0# --
A newcomer to #X_2#'s reign, he is an ensign who is shocked by the regular injustices that take place aboard the Caine.

-- #X_0# --
The last ensign to report to the #X_1# under #X_2#'s rule, he is exactly what #X_3# was when #X_3# first came aboard the ship. He demonstrates the continuity of the #Y_0#'s program of indoctrinating sailors.

-- #X_0# --
A powerful dog, half St. Bernard and half sheepdog, who is stolen from a #Y_0# estate and sold as a sled dog in the Arctic. #X_0#gradually evolves from a pampered pet into a fierce, masterful animal, able to hold his own in the cruel, kill-or-be-killed world of the North. Though he loves his final master, #X_1#, he feels the wild calling him away from civilization and longs to reconnect with the primitive roots of his species.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s final master, a gold hunter experienced in the ways of the Klondike. #X_3# saves #X_1# from death at the hands of #X_2#, and #X_1# rewards #X_3# with fierce loyalty. #X_3#’s relationship to #X_1# is the ideal man-dog relationship: each guards the other’s back and is completely devoted to the other. The strength of their bond is enough to keep #X_1# from acting on the forces he feels are calling him into the wild.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s archrival and the original leader of #X_2#’s dog team. #X_0# is a fierce animal—a “devil-dog,” one man calls him—who is used to fighting with other dogs and winning. He meets his match in #X_1#, however, who is as strong as #X_0# and possesses more cunning. #X_0# is an amoral being who fights for survival with all of his might, disregarding what is right and wrong.

-- #X_0# --
A French Canadian mail driver who buys #X_2# and adds him to his team. #X_0# is an experienced man, accustomed to life in the North, and he impresses #X_2# with his fairness and good sense.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
An American gold seeker, #X_0# comes to #Y_0# with his sister, #X_3#, and her husband, #X_2#, in search of adventure and riches. The three buy #X_1# and his team and try to drive them, but their inexperience makes them terrible masters, as they run out of food during the journey and bicker among themselves. #X_0# and his companions are meant to represent the weakness of overcivilized men and to embody the man-dog relationship at its worst.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s wife and #X_2#’s sister. #X_0# is spoiled and pampered, and her unreasonable demands slow her, #X_2#, and #X_1# on their journey and contribute to its disastrous ending. Her civilized manner, however, contrasts that of her unprepared brother and husband in that she initially feels sympathetic for the worn-out sled team. Her behavior, #X_3# suggests, demonstrates how civilized women are unsuited for life in the wild, having been spoiled and babied by the men around them.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s brother-in-law and #X_2#’ husband. #X_0#shares their inexperience and folly.

-- #X_0# --
A dog on #X_1#’s team. #X_0# becomes ill on one of the team’s journeys but refuses to leave the harness, preferring to die pulling the sled. In his stubbornness at this task, #X_0# is an example of gritty determination.

-- #X_0# --
An older, more experienced dog on #X_1#’s team.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_1#’s, met on the journey to the North. #X_0#’s death, when she naively tries to be friendly to a husky, acts as a warning to #X_1# of the harshness and cruelty of his new home.

The protagonist of the novel, #X_0# is a good-hearted but hopelessly naïve young man. His mentor, #X_2#, teaches him that their world is “the best of all possible worlds.” After being banished from his adopted childhood home, #X_0# travels the world and meets with a wide variety of misfortunes, all the while pursuing security and following #X_1#, the woman he loves. His faith in #X_2#’s undiluted optimism is repeatedly tested. #X_0# is less a realistic character than a conduit for the attitudes and events that surround him. His opinions and actions are determined almost entirely by the influence of outside factors.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a philosopher and #X_1#’s tutor. His optimistic belief that this world is “the best of all possible worlds” is the primary target of the novel’s satire. #X_0#’s own experiences contradict this belief, but he remains faithful to it nonetheless. Like #X_1#, #X_0# is not a three-dimensional character. Instead, he is an exaggerated parody of overly optimistic Enlightenment philosophers.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a cynical scholar whom #X_1# befriends as a travel companion. #X_0# has suffered a great deal in his life and preaches a philosophy of undiluted pessimism. More knowledgeable and intelligent than either #X_1# or #X_2#, #X_0# is nonetheless a flawed philosopher. Because he always expects nothing but the worst from the world, he often has trouble seeing the world as it really is.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the daughter of a German baron who acts as #X_1#’s benefactor until he discovers #X_1#’s love for his daughter. Throughout much of the novel, #X_0# is young and beautiful. After her father’s castle is destroyed in war, a number of exploitative men enslave her or use her as a mistress. #X_0# returns #X_1#’s love but is willing to betray him for the sake of her own interests. Like him, she is neither intelligent nor complex. Her very blandness casts a satiric light on #X_1#’s mad romantic passion for her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# becomes #X_1#’s valet when #X_1# travels in South America. A mixed-race native of the Americas, #X_0# is highly intelligent and morally honest. He is savvy and single-handedly rescues #X_1# from a number of scrapes. He is also directly responsible for #X_1#’s reunion with #X_2#. As a practical man of action, he stands in direct opposition to ineffectual philosophers such as #X_4# and #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# was born the daughter of a Pope. She has experienced the death of a fiancé, rape by pirates, slavery, and cannibalism in wartime. She becomes #X_1#’s servant.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0# is #X_2#’s brother. After his family’s castle is destroyed in wartime, he becomes a Jesuit priest. It is implied numerous times that he has homosexual tendencies.

Brother #X_3# is one of her clients. In #Y_0#, #X_1# is moved by #X_0#’s misery and gives her a large sum of money, which she quickly squanders.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
A group of down-and-out but always scheming men who live together in the run-down fish-meal shack, owned by #X_5#, which they call #Y_1#. #X_0# is their ringleader, a smart, charismatic man who can charm anyone into anything; as one of the #X_0# says, #X_0# could be president of #Y_2# if he wanted to be, but he wouldn't want to do anything like that that wasn't fun. #X_0#'s attempts to do things the easy way and to his advantage often get him into trouble. #X_2#, another of the #X_0#, is a substitute bartender at #Y_0#, the local bar. He brings home stolen bottles and a jug filled with remnants from customers' drinks; this makes him immensely popular all around. #X_4# is perhaps the hardest-working of the #X_0#: He often accompanies #X_1# on collecting trips. Ironically, though, the narrative claims he was too lazy to pick up real criminal habits as a boy. He got his name because his overworked mother didn't notice what his gender was when he was born. #X_3# lives with the #X_0# because his wife beats him. He is often at the local bar or in jail as a result of brawls with his wife. #X_3# is a gifted mechanic who can make any vehicle run.

-- #X_0# --
The proprietor of #Y_0#, a specimen supply house. #X_0# is a gentle, melancholy man who is a source of culture, benevolence, and aid for all on the Row. He introduces #X_1#'s girls and the boys to opera, classical music, and literature, and he takes #X_2# in and cares for him. He is also a bit of a womanizer. Somehow, though, #X_0# always seems lonely, and everyone on the Row is constantly wanting to do something to show him how much he is loved.

-- #X_0# --
The local madam; proprietor of #Y_0#, a brothel. #X_0# is a huge woman with bright orange hair and flamboyant clothes. She runs a tight ship - her girls aren't allowed to drink or talk to men on the street - but she is kindhearted and generous. She paid the grocery bills for many local families during the Depression, and she organizes an aid effort during the influenza epidemic. She is always in danger of being shut down by the authorities, so she must watch her step and do twice as much charitable giving as anyone else.

-- #X_0# --
The Chinese grocer of the Row. #X_0#'s store stocks absolutely everything, and he is willing to engage in almost any transaction, provided it's profitable and risk-free. Sometimes, however, his calculations prove to be wrong, as the business with #X_3# and the frogs shows. #X_0# is a shrewd, even occasionally manipulative, businessman but also good-hearted; he extends credit generously, tries to take care of the unfortunate, helps with the parties for #X_1#, and even arranged for his grandfather to be disinterred and reburied in his homeland.

-- #X_0# --
A mentally handicapped boy who is neglected by his mother and taken in by #X_2#. #X_0# is incapable of doing any work; he just seems to do everything a little bit wrong. He loves #X_2#, though, and frequently tells him so. #X_0# is institutionalized after breaking in to a jewelry store to steal a gift for #X_2#. #X_0# can be compared to #X_1# in #X_3#'s The Sound and the Fury or to #X_4# in #X_5#'s own Of Mice and Men.

-- #X_0# --
The local artist and a friend of #X_1#'s. Although he pretends to be, #X_0# is not actually French. He keeps up on the latest trends from #Y_0# and is always forming new sets of principles (e.g., no red paint, chicken feathers only) by which to do his work. No one is certain about #X_0#'s artistic abilities, but everyone agrees he's doing a beautiful job building his boat, which is up on blocks in a vacant lot. The boat will never be finished because #X_0# is afraid of the ocean, but, more importantly, it is his life's work. A series of women come and go from the boat.

-- #X_0# --
A fantastically powerful mess officer, #X_0# controls an international black-market syndicate and is revered in obscure corners all over the world. He ruthlessly chases after profit and bombs his own men as part of a contract with #Y_0#. #X_0# insists that everyone in the squadron will benefit from being part of the syndicate and that “everyone has a share.” He also takes his job as mess officer very, very seriously; as a result, the troops in #X_1#’s division eat better than any others.

-- #X_0# --

The ambitious, unintelligent officer in charge of #X_1#’s squadron. #X_0# wants to be a general, and he tries to impress his superiors by bravely volunteering his men for dangerous combat duty whenever he gets the chance.

-- #X_0# --

He finds the hypocrisy and ugliness of the world around him almost unbearable, and through his cynicism he tries to protect himself from the pain and disappointment of the adult world. However, the criticisms that #X_0# aims at people around him are also aimed at himself. He is uncomfortable with his own weaknesses, and at times displays as much phoniness, meanness, and superficiality as anyone else in the book.

A very attractive girl whom #X_1# has known and dated for a long time. Though #X_0# is well read, #X_1# claims that she is “stupid,” although it is difficult to tell whether this judgment is based in reality or merely in #X_1#’s ambivalence about being sexually attracted to her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s mother. Fat, breathless, sincere, earnest, crude, and bedecked in flashy gems, #X_0# is a woman embarrassingly dedicated to a man who despises her and in feeble denial of her husband's disgust. She considers #X_1# her "only son."

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#was the beautiful wife of #X_3# #X_0#. She died while giving birth to #X_6#. #X_3# exhibited little affection or concern for his wife when she was alive, and his attitude went unchanged by her sudden death.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#was a key researcher in the development of the atomic bomb dropped on #Y_0#. When #X_4# began researching the #X_0# family, he quickly learned that #X_0# cared little for human responsibilities. #X_0# approached his work as if it were an amusing game, regardless of the content of the research. #X_0# was emotionally indifferent to other people, including his family, simply because people were not his "specialty." When a marine general asked him to solve the problem of mud, #X_0# began working on the creation of an isotope of water, which he called ice-nine, that was solid at room temperature. Unfortunately, #X_0# succeeded in creating ice-nine, but he kept no records of his research.

He preferred to live comfortably without having to deal with the concerns of other people. He convinced #X_5# to become President in his place.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, a four-feet tall midget, is the youngest child of #X_2# and Emily #X_0#. #X_0#'s mother died while giving birth to him. #X_0# hoped to find happiness when he became engaged to #X_3#, a Ukrainian midget belonging to a dance company.

She was the child of Nestor #X_0#, a Finnish architect who died prior to her birth, and a native of #Y_0#. #X_0# adopted the unusually beautiful girl to raise his popularity, and he turned her into a national erotic symbol. #X_2# successfully convinced #X_3# to become President of #Y_0# when he mentioned that #X_0# would marry him.

He told #X_3# about #X_2#'s attempts to create ice-nine. When #X_3# nervously asked if #X_2# had succeeded, #X_0# denied it and furiously ended the interview.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# met #X_0# and #X_0# on the plane to #Y_0#. They were traveling to the island to investigate the possibility of moving their bicycle           manufacturing business to the island because they found #Y_1# labor regulations too restrictive. #X_0# and #X_0# are characterized by the ignorant           hubris of typical Americans.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# and #X_0# worked as secretaries at #Y_0#, transcribing documents that neither of them really understood. #X_0# gave #X_4# a tour of #X_2#'s lab.

-- #X_0# --
A marine deserter, #X_0# hired #X_1# to transport him to #Y_3#. However, they shipwrecked on San Lorenzo, which lacked a government at the time. Seeing the horrendous poverty and disease among the island residents, which was partly the result of the #Y_2# Corporation's abusive labor practices, #X_1# and #X_0# set out to make the island into a utopia. Because #Y_2# had never turned a profit on San Lorenzo, the company retreated without protest when #X_0# and #X_1# declared themselves in charge of the island. #X_0# and #X_1# quickly realized that no amount of legal and economic reform could improve the standard of living for the island's residents. #X_1# sought to comfort the island's citizens with a religion, #X_1#ism, based on lies. At his request, #X_0#, now a dictator, outlawed #X_1#ism so that it would be more exciting and meaningful to its practitioners. The strain of playing their roles in this charade drove both #X_1# and #X_0# a little insane. #X_0# began executing people in truth, though he never killed #X_1# because, without him, his own role as tyrant would be meaningless.

-- #X_0# --

A boy who cares only for television. The more guns and violence on a show, the more #X_0# likes it. #X_0# is slightly more complex than the other bad children in that he is smart enough to realize when Mr. #X_1# is lying to him.

He also will launch into overly sentimental and rhetorical speeches before his niece #X_1# stops him, after which he always mutters "I am silent" at least once. #X_0# is a kind and concerned uncle and brother, but he behaves very differently around people not of his own social class. He is fifty-one years old, but as he notes, this is "difficult to believe", because he is in many ways an infant. He constantly pops sweets into his mouth, insults people (such as #X_3#) with whom he disagrees, and has to be reminded to put on his jacket by #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_2#'s adopted daughter, who is twenty-four years old. She is in love with #X_1#, but she doubts that he will ever propose to her. #X_0# is hard-working and responsible and has a similar work ethic to #X_1#. She is also something of cry-baby, often in tears; but this may reflect her sense of powerlessness, as she is the one character in the play who may be most affected by the loss of the estate. She is the estate's manager, so she will lose her job if #X_3# loses the estate, but, lacking money or a husband, she has no control over its fate or her own.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s biological daughter, #X_0# is seventeen years old. She seems to have lived a sheltered life. She greatly enjoys the company of #X_2# and his lofty idealism, and is quick to comfort her mother after the loss of her orchard. #X_0# and #X_2# become so close that #X_3# fears they may become romantically involved.

-- #X_0# --
A student at the local university, he knows #X_3# from tutoring her son #X_1# before he died. #X_2# refers to #X_0# as the "eternal student," for he has been in university most of his adult life. He serves as a foil for both #X_2# and #X_3#; #X_0#'s ugliness, belief that he is "above love", and forward-looking nature contrasts with #X_3#'s beauty, her idealistic vision of love, and her obsession with the past, while his utopian idealism contrasts with #X_2#'s practicality and materialism.

-- #X_0# --
A nobleman, and fellow landowner, who is, like #X_3#, in financial difficulties. #X_2# is characterized mainly by his boundless optimism—he is always certain he will find the money somehow to pay for the mortgages that are due—but also by his continual borrowing money from #X_3#. #X_2# is something of a caricature; his name, in Russian, means "squealer," appropriate for someone who never stops talking.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s governess. #X_0# traveled from town-to-town performing tricks such as "the dive of death" when she was very young, before her Father and #X_2# both died. #X_0# is something of a clown, performing tricks for the amusement of the elite around her, such as #X_4#, #X_3#, and #X_5#, while, at the same time, subtly mocking their pre-occupations.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s eighty-seven-year-old manservant. #X_0# is always talking about how things were in the past on the estate, when the estate was prosperous, and the master went to #Y_0# by carriage, instead of by train; most importantly, he frequently talks about how life was before the serfs were freed. He is possibly senile, and is constantly mumbling. He is the only surviving link to the estate's glorious past, and he comes to symbolize that past.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a clerk at the #X_2# estate. He is a source of amusement for all the other workers and amusement for all the other workers, who refer to him as "Simple #X_0#". #X_0# provides comic relief, with his self-conscious pose as the hopeless lover and romantic, often contemplating suicide. He loves #X_1#, to whom he has proposed.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the young manservant who has been traveling with #X_3# ever since she left for #Y_0#. He is always complaining about how uncivilized #Y_1# is when compared to #Y_0#, exploits #X_1#'s love for him for physical pleasure, and openly tells #X_2# that he is so old he should die. Most of the characters besides #X_3# regard him as repulsive and obnoxious. He has a strong taste for acrid-smelling cigars.

-- #X_0# --
A maid on the #X_1# estate. She functions mainly as a foil to #X_2#, her innocent naïveté and love for him emphasizing and making clear his cynicism and selfishness. She is also the object of #X_3#'s affections, a status about which she is very confused.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# alien being that the #Y_0# serve. #X_0#is not a creature of matter; it is not solid. It is a kind of "collective conscious," a massive entity of thought and energy that crosses the galaxy, and perhaps the universe, trying to "increase its awareness of the universe." It incorporates entire races into itself, eliminating their individuality while greatly enhancing their power.

-- #X_0# --
The author of, and central player in, the diary. #X_0#, forty-one years old and the mother of three young children, lives in a favela, or slum,in #Y_0#. She collects paper scraps to sell in or#X_0#r to buy food and writes in her diary about daily life. In contrast to the other women of the favela, #X_0# does not drink, engage in fighting, or otherwise compromise the safety of her children. She has also resolved not to marry. Perceptive, critical, and sometimes dryly humorous, #X_0# creates an accurate record of life in the favela.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s youngest child. #X_0# is two when the diary begins, and her longings for nice clothes and food are particularly difficult for #X_1# to cope with. At one point, #X_0# asks to be given to a richer family so that she might have what favela life lacks—a request that pains #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s middle child. #X_0# is almost five when the diary begins. At one point, #X_0# is detained at the local police station for truancy. When #X_1# picks him up, she is relieved to find him crying rather than acting like the hardened child-criminals who surround him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s oldest son. #X_0# is eight when the diary begins. When a neighbor accuses him of raping her daughter midway through the diary, he is interrogated by the local authorities, who ask prying questions in front of his brother and sister about his knowledge of sex. Nothing comes of the charges by the end of the book.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s long-time lover. #X_0# appears to be better than the favelados: he doesn’t drink, he works, and he dresses and behaves like a man of a much higher station. #X_0# would like to marry #X_1#, but her feelings about him fluctuate. On one hand, she thinks very highly of him and has obvious affection for him, though she is fundamentally resistant to the idea of marrying anyone. #X_0# grows jealous of #X_1#’s relationship with the gypsy #X_2#, though he comes back to her, as she predicts.

-- #X_0# --

However, #X_0# is not as perfect as #X_1# initially makes him out to be. He’s fickle, can’t be pinned down, and openly pursues other women. When #X_1# sees him eyeing a fourteen-year-old girl, she resolves to have nothing more to do with him.

-- #X_0# --
The reporter who helps #X_1# get published in a weekly magazine, #Y_1#. #X_0# discovers #X_1# when he overhears her threatening to put some troublemakers in her “book.”#X_0#’s aid also allows #X_1#’s diary to be published in book form.

#X_0# #X_0# woman who dies as a result of #X_1#’s break-in. #X_0# #X_0# woman lives alone with her cats and seems crazy.

-- #X_0# --
Ten-year-old girls whom #X_1# rapes. These girls are typical youth who ditch school when they want, listen to pop music, and talk in their own slang. #X_1# finds them in the record store in Part One.

-- #X_0# --
The police officer partnered with #X_4# and #X_3#. #X_0# is nonchalant when #X_3# and #X_4# beat #X_2#. He calmly sits in the car, reading a book and smoking a cigarette.

-- #X_0# --
A record store employee. #X_0# is thin and bald and likes classical music. He sells #X_2# a copy of #X_3#’s Ninth Symphony in Part One.

-- #X_0# --
The first act's protagonist, #X_0#is the model British aristocrat, at least at first glance. He puts his duty to country above all else and expects those that depend on him to behave according to his will. #X_0#believes that sex-roles are clearly defined and refuses to accept otherwise, expecting his son #X_2# to be just as masculine as he is. Almost daily, #X_0#struggles to keep his family proper and intact. He is a racist who believes the African natives to be "savages" that can only be tamed by his firm British discipline. Although his principles may seem clear, #X_0#does engage in an affair with Mrs. #X_3#, breaking the standard of fidelity that he tries to impose upon his wife #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
In the first act, #X_0#, played by a man, spends most of her time confused and incapable of making any decisions of her own. She relies totally upon her husband #X_1# to provide direction in her life. #X_0#does not, however, lack a sense of adventure. She dreams of a relationship with #X_3#, wondering what life might be like outside of her own. #X_0#remains caught between her duty to family and her yearning for romance.         In Act II, a new #X_0#, played by a new actor, acquires a sense of independence and evolves into the play's protagonist. This #X_0#is older, however, and prone to long-winded lectures and unsolicited comment. The new #X_0#finds independence intriguing, but frightening and her relationship to her children #X_4# and #X_2# often seems to be the only thing to keep her sane.

-- #X_0# --
At a young age, #X_0#(played by a woman in Act I) discovers a proclivity for feminine things and an attraction to other males. However, he keeps his yearnings in check for fear of upsetting his conservative father. These fears subside, but do not disappear as #X_0#grows up. The older #X_0#of Act II (played by a man) finds that he fits well into the role of mother and wife. He prefers steady companionship to promiscuity, but has difficulty asserting himself to get what he wants.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, although unimportant to the first act (perhaps because she is played by a dummy) emerges as a central figure of the play in the second act. Like others in her family, #X_0#is prone to dependence but has moments of self- reliance. #X_0#is usually non-confrontational, preferring the role of peace- maker. She feels pain and uncertainty in her search for identity.

-- #X_0# --
On the surface, #X_0#, a British explorer, represents British courage and discovery. However, #X_0#'s acclaim as an explorer masks a deviant sexual appetite. #X_0#'s presence, while seemingly harmless, begins to bring out the deep sexual leanings of the members of #X_1#'s family. Ultimately, #X_0# is as much a victim to his actions as the others. He sacrifices his freedom to avoid persecution for his homosexuality.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0#, a widow, exhibits a unique sovereignty in a world where women are expected to be dutiful mothers and wives. She is unafraid to wield her sexuality, and she demands respect from the men with whom she comes into contact. #X_0#has a sense of justice and does not readily accept British tradition and the habits of colonialists.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is a brash lesbian, unafraid to let others know where she stands. Nevertheless, beneath her combativeness, #X_0#is hurt and uncertain about her ability to be a good mother. She is crass and stubborn at first, but does allow those whom she cares about to get below the surface.

-- #X_0# --
Sex-obsessed #X_0# likes to think aloud, working out his relationship to wife #X_4# in long speeches. #X_0# often feels incompetent and frustrates himself by over-thinking his sex life. He demonstrates a tendency to think for others, which can offend those with whom he comes into contact. #X_0# does have a giving side, which he demonstrates in his relationship to #X_2#'s daughter #X_1# and his own son #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, #X_3#'s governess, possesses a strong sense of duty to #X_2#'s family. She is also dependent upon them and afraid of being sent away. #X_0#, too, is working out her sexuality, and nervously tests her attraction to #X_1# at times. Ultimately, #X_0# cannot reconcile her desires with her lot in life, and thus remains unhappy.

-- #X_0# --
A promiscuous homosexual, #X_0# has trouble staying in any one place for too long. His relationships fail because of his distaste for commitment. #X_0# would like companionship but is reluctant to give up his freedoms.

-- #X_0# --
Honest, reliable and dutiful, #X_0#appears to be the perfect servant. He betrays his people to be with #X_1#. Underneath #X_0#'s loyalty, however, anger ferments. He is loyal only for personal gain, and his loyalty stops when his real family is threatened.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, a five year old girl played by a man, is not exactly normal, to say the least. For her age, #X_0#has a remarkable knowledge of inappropriate words and phrases. She seems to harbor aggression, making her susceptible to occasional outbursts. Her disposition derives, in part, from her fear that her mother #X_1# will leave her. #X_0#'s desire to fit in drives most of her actions throughout Act II.

-- #X_0# --
Always a traditionalist, #X_0#encourages the women around her to behave as she does. She has a penchant for crankiness when her relatives fall out of line, insisting, "she knows best." #X_0#adheres to the notion that women are meant to serve and honor their husbands by taking care of the home. She is a well- intentioned mother and grandmother, but her values seem outdated as her guidance often falls upon deaf ears.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s son.

-- #X_0# --
An Athenian citizen and harried father, burdened by the debts his son, Pheidippides, has incurred. #X_0# is the "hero" of the play, but he is not very heroic. He is concerned instead with pursuing his dishonest aim: shirking his debts instead of taking responsibility for them. Therefore, #X_0# is more of an "anti-hero." He does not have the subtle, esoteric mind that it takes to succeed at the school, but rather frustrates #X_2# and the other Students at the school with his stubbornness, his violence, and his limited, literal mind. He is a pragmatist, not a philosopher, and as such he is rooted in the physical world, happiest delivering a sound beating or masturbating. Because of his bumbling, brutish physicality, he is a fitting foil to #X_2#'s pure intellectualism.

-- #X_0# --
The spend-thrift and arrogant son of #X_2#. He has adopted the aristocratic posturing of his mother and #X_3# and demonstrates a passion for horses as well as a passion for esoteric knowledge. He is cocky and smug and proves a receptive pupil for the subtle rhetoric taught by #X_1#. He is fascinated by himself—at first, his own material needs and finally his own whirling dervish of an intellect—and his egotism makes him cruel and ruthless.

-- #X_0# --
The master-sophist at the infamous school. #X_0# is a spokesman for the "new education" of rhetoric, atheism, science, and sophistry. He represents the heights of esoteric knowledge—so removed from the reality of everyday life in #Y_0# as to appear floating! In contrast to the brutish physicality of #X_1#, #X_0# represents pure, rarified intellect at its most ethereal and impractical. However, #X_0# is not "above" human emotions such as anger and impatience, especially when plagued with such a buffoonish student as #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# personified quasi-divinities who bring rain and thunder. #X_0#acts as a core voice in the play, explaining certain motives and egging on the action. At times, they act as prophets, foreshadowing actions and obstacles to come. #X_0#can interact directly with the audience and thus may seem to be removed from the action of the scene, much like the gods the chorus is supposed to be replacing. #X_0# chorus' prescience and sense of resolve makes its members obvious candidates for divinity; with their singing and dancing en masse they lend the necessary air of ritual and spirituality. Also, because the #X_0# members speak directly to the audience about the play and about playwriting itself, they become mouthpieces for #X_1# himself.

-- #X_0# --
A personified school of thought. #X_0# is Just #X_0#'s necessary foil. Like #X_2#, #X_0# represents all that is wrong with sophistry and the "new education"—the specious moral content masked by slippery, well-wrought persuasion and rhetoric. Like #X_1#, #X_0# is smug and disdainful of tradition. He has a facile mind, if not necessarily an upright set of values.

-- #X_0# --
A personified school of thought. #X_0# is Unjust #X_0#'s necessary foil. He, like #X_2#, represents the "old" or "traditional" system of education, one that stressed obedience, reverence for one's elders, values indoctrinated in martial poetry such as #X_1#, and physical fitness. However, like #X_2#, #X_0#'s overdeveloped sense of the physical will be his undoing: his own over-zealous sexual appetite undermines the moral content in his argument, making him into a foolish pederast and not a wise pedagogue.

-- #X_0# --
A disciple at #X_1#'s school who shows #X_2# the ropes with characteristic verbal flair and an air of secrecy worthy of the Free-Masons. The #X_0# takes great, albeit serious, delight in the minutiae of #X_1#'s scientific investigations. He is, however, defensive of his school when #X_2# drops by and he acts defensively, even a bit neurotically, in order to maintain the order and sanctity of their proceedings.

-- #X_0# --
An angry Athenian to whom #X_1# owes money. He comes to demand #X_1#'s appearance in court and acts with great brashness and surety. He pays great attention to detail and procedure—attention that he demonstrates in bringing a witness with him when he pays his call. He is not overjoyed to be prosecuting #X_1#, but acts with good energy and organization in preparing his case.

-- #X_0# --
A mopey Athenian to whom #X_2# owes money. He is a morose, weepy figure, prone to swearing great, pathetic oaths to the gods. A comical figure of pathos. A great Greek #X_1# (of Winnie the Pooh fame).

-- #X_0# --
A household slave to #X_1#. He is obedient, but will stand up for himself when challenged.

-- #X_0# --
A philosopher-sophist from #X_1#'s school. Renowned for his paleness and his esoteric intellect, he is also whiny and helpless.

-- #X_0# --
Pupils of #X_2# and #X_1#. Blind adherents to esoteric knowledge. Moony, silent, pale types without physical vigor.

-- #X_0# --
The male protagonist. The novel follows #X_0#’s journey home from the slaughter he has witnessed in the Civil War. #X_0# is intelligent, literate, and sensitive, although he often appears emotionally reserved. Troubled by the carnage he has witnessed, #X_0# seeks spiritual solace in the natural world and in his memories of #X_1#. He attempts to retain his hope and his faith in a better world in the face of incomprehensible violence and cruelty.

-- #X_0# --
The female protagonist and #X_1#’s lover. Roughly half of the novel is written from her perspective. #X_0# is a highly educated, literate, and intensely private young woman. The novel begins six years after she moves with her father from #Y_0# to #Y_1#. She has experienced  the hardship and loss of her father’s death, and she has been left penniless and in charge of the farm. #X_0# feels alienated from small town society and rejects its restrictive mentality.

-- #X_0# --
To an extent, #X_0# is a foil to #X_1#. Uneducated and illiterate, #X_0# possesses a store of knowledge about the natural world that she gleaned while younger, when her father would leave her for weeks at a time to go drinking. #X_0# speaks plainly and insists on being treated like an equal. She possesses a warm and loyal heart underneath her gruff exterior. She supports her father when he returns as an army deserter to seek her help.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s dead father and the old preacher of Cold Mountain. #X_0# moved with his daughter to #Y_0# to speed his recovery from consumption. His wife died giving birth their daughter. A kind man and unconventional preacher, #X_0# recognizes in hindsight that he has been overly protective of #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father. Despite his drunk and disreputable past, #X_0# partially redeems himself through music. He delights in composing and performing his own fiddle tunes. As an outlier living in a cave on Cold Mountain, #X_0# looks to his daughter for help in evading #Y_0#. Even when down on his luck, #X_0# always manages to pull through, as evidenced by his narrow brush with death at the hands of #X_3#’s men.

-- #X_0# --
A preacher whom #X_2# exposes for trying to murder his pregnant lover. #X_0# reunites with #X_2# on his journey west, proving to be an unintentionally dangerous, though humorous, traveling companion. As he uses religion to justify his immoral acts, #X_0# symbolizes both the hypocrisy of false faith and unrestrained selfishness.

-- #X_0# --
A fellow outlier and friend of #X_1#’s. Though simple-minded, #X_0# possesses a talent for playing the banjo and teams up with #X_1# to form a musical duo. #X_0#’s death stands as a testament to man’s heartlessness in times of war and to wasted human life.

-- #X_0# --
A woman who lives in the mountains and raises goats, whom #X_2# encounters on his journey. #X_0# possesses a strong connection to the natural world, healing #X_2#’s wounds with the help of food and medicine. #X_1# uses her character to highlight the advantages and the disadvantages of a reclusive life (advantages and disadvantages which #X_2# ponders throughout his journey). Although the #X_0# finds her solace in nature, #X_2# realizes that she has sacrificed a deeper human relationship in order to do so.

-- #X_0# --
The leader of a band of #Y_1#, a local militia charged with rounding up the deserters. #X_0# is a cunning sadist who is mentioned by both the #X_1#’s neighbors, the #Y_0#, and the captive with fear and disgust. He represents the assumed authority of the army whose crimes are justified in the name of war. His execution of #X_4# and other outliers in the text foreshadows #X_3#’s death at the hands of #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s young associate who kills #X_1#. Although #X_0# convinces #X_2# to bring the captive into town instead of hanging him, he is not a sympathetic figure. With his white hair and glassy eyes, the boy appears deadened by the violence he has witnessed.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
A peddler who meets #X_2# at an inn and tells him the sad tale of his lifelong search for #X_3#, the slave-girl that he loves. #X_0#’s story parallels #X_2#’s own quest to return to #Y_0# and acts as a reminder that the Southern army was fighting in part to uphold the legality of slavery.

-- #X_0# --
A deserter awaiting execution whose tale #X_1# and #X_2# overhear one day in town. #X_0# man tells of his experiences at the hands of #X_3#’s band of #Y_0#, who shot his father for harboring outliers. #X_0#insists that the world is about to end because of the evil perpetrated in the name of war. #X_0# prisoner is the only character to speak out against the war because he has nothing left to lose.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s closest neighbors and friends. #X_0# oppose the war, although both their sons are off fighting. Deeply religious, the couple was offended by #X_2#’s assumptions when he first arrived at #Y_0# that they did not know the Bible. In an important, neighborly gesture, #X_4# sends #X_3# to help out at the farm after realizing that #X_1# intends to run it herself. #X_0# possess the quiet endurance that characterizes many people in the novel.

#X_2#'s mother, she suffered from polio her entire life. Soft-spoken and meek, she deferred to #X_2#'s father in virtually all matters. While she came from a well-to-do background, her family had little to do with her because of her handicap. #X_2# felt that her mother was good to her, and suffered a lifelong sense of guilt for not taking better care of #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --

He is practical, business-minded, hard-working, determined, resourceful, intelligent, and possessed of an unbelievably good memory. He has a firm idea of right and wrong, and he is a staunch proponent of American democratic and capitalistic ideals. He believes in the power of technology and progress and detests narrow-minded adherence to superstition. He is a devout Protestant who values religious freedom and blames #Y_1# for many of the ills of medieval society. He is a born leader, and the idea of inherited rank and strict social stratification disgusts him.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_3#'s most trusted friend. He begins as a friendly but fairly ignorant page who takes a liking to the #X_3# and offers him aid.

-- #X_0# --
A pretty but somewhat flighty damsel who comes to #X_2#'s court seeking assistance and becomes attached to the #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A wise and gracious king. He tries his best, but he has a full share of the prejudices and superstitions of the day. The Yankee's opinion of his intellectual capacity varies, but he is capable of learning and of correcting his mistakes.

-- #X_0# --
A hack magician with the fatal flaw of actually believing in his own sleight of hand. #X_0# is deceptive and petty and terribly vindictive; he would be an incredibly dangerous person if any of his tricks ever worked.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is the vehicle through which #X_1# changes and evolves as a person. #X_0#is more than a boxing trainer; he functions as a life teacher. He always tells it like it is, is completely candid, and never sugarcoats the truth. He understands #X_1#'s motivations to be involved in boxing without #X_1# ever having to tell him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#takes care of #X_1# in the wake of #X_1#'s parents' death. She is a positive familial force in his life, although she disapproves of the boxing. The violence of the sport worries her, and she wishes #X_1# would devote himself to safer, more productive activities. However, she allows #X_1# to do it because she understands what it means to be able to pursue a dream, regardless of whether or not it comes to fruition.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_1#'s best friend, but #X_0# represents yet another aspect of #X_1#'s life that is stripped away. Throughout the book #X_1# struggles to maintain and regain #X_0#'s trust and friendship, as well as attempt to steer him away from drugs and crime. He and #X_0# used to do everything together, but throughout the course of the book their paths diverge, almost irreconcilably.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# and #X_3# try to push #X_1# in the direction of #X_4#. They invite #X_1# to parties and encourage his involvement in crime and drugs.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# gets #X_1# involved in boxing by mentioning that he works with Mr. #X_2#. #X_0# is a father figure for #X_1#, helping him with his training inside and outside of the ring. #X_0# brings #X_1# home after he is badly beaten up by #X_4# and #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a role model for #X_1# not only because #X_0# was a boxer, but because he gave up boxing in order to go back to school. #X_0#'s house is the one in which #X_1# spends eating, resting, and relaxing the day of a fight.

-- #X_0# --

He is a quiet, humble, and gentle man with a strong moral sense and an abiding faith in God. He is not perfect, however, and occasionally gives in to the temptation to hurt others with harsh words or lies. The dignity and grace with which he accepts his suffering, however, along with his determination to help his people in spite of his limitations, make him the moral center of the novel.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s other protagonist, a white landowner whose farm overlooks #Y_1#. When he first appears in the novel, #X_0# is a relatively conservative farmer and a man of few words.

-- #X_0# --
Stephen #X_0#’s son. After fleeing home for #Y_0#, #X_0# quickly goes astray, but even after he commits murder, he is able to reclaim his fundamental decency. His decision to move to #Y_0# is part of a larger trend of young black people fleeing their villages for the cities. #X_0#’s story is a cautionary tale of the dangers of this movement. Seeming to lack a reliable moral compass, he is influenced by bad companions and begins a criminal career.

-- #X_0# --

Stephen #X_0#’s strong-minded, supportive, and loving wife. #X_0# and her husband make household decisions as equals, and she bears hardship gracefully.

-- #X_0# --
Stephen #X_0#’s sister and the original reason for his trip to #Y_0#. #X_0#, twenty-five years younger than #X_0# and living in #Y_0#, is easily influenced. When #X_0# reminds her of her Christian duties and obligations, she attempts to return to them, but she lacks real determination.

A #X_0# white #X_0# who works at the reformatory and attempts to reform #X_1#. Although he does, on one occasion, chastise #X_2#, he does so because he cares much for his pupils, and the thought of #X_1#’s predicament pains him.

Although grateful for the help of good white men, he nonetheless looks forward to an Africa in which black people will not rely on whites for their basic needs.

-- #X_0# --
John #X_0#’s son. We learn little about #X_0#, but he is important to the plot of the novel, as he is a good friend and eventual accomplice of #X_1#’s. Eventually, however, #X_0# denies having been present at the robbery, turning his back on his cousin and friend.

After her ex-boyfriend, #X_2#, names her executor of his immense and complex estate, she discovers and begins to unravel a worldwide conspiracy in southern #Y_0#. #X_0# functions in the novel as a type of detective, although the story is as much about her own self-discoveries as it is about the mystery she attempts to piece together.

As a boy, he joined the group that went to the woods to see the old woman’s body. Many years later, the narrator suddenly remembers the event and begins to narrate the story of the old woman’s life and death. Though he finds it difficult to articulate why, he feels compelled to retell this childhood tale. In the intervening years, the narrator has had several experiences that echo certain incidents in the old woman’s life.

-- #X_0# --
An old, sickly woman who lived on a farm near the narrator’s childhood town. The old woman had a history of poor treatment. As a young orphan, she was legally bound to a German couple who abused her, and as an adult she lived in poverty on a small, remote farm with a husband and son who treated her just as poorly. The old woman bore her trials with a silent stoicism before dying in the woods in the company of a pack of dogs.

-- #X_0# --
The old woman’s husband. A rough, brutal man, #X_0# was a mean drunk who was distrusted and disliked in town. He was rumored to be a horse thief, but had never been caught. Like his wife, #X_0# spoke very little in the story, although his silence suggested menace rather than forbearance.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# old woman and Jake #X_0# twenty-one-year-old son. Unnamed in the story, the #X_0# son inherited his father’s violent, brutish ways.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# old woman and Jake #X_0# daughter, who died before the story’s events took place.

-- #X_0# --
A couple to whom the young Mrs. #X_1# was bound as an indentured servant. On several occasions, the #X_0# attempted to sexually assault the young girl, but he was always foiled by the wife’s return. #X_0# wife, in turn, suspected the girl of being involved with her husband and harassed her because of it.

-- #X_0# --
A man who took pity on the old woman on the day she died. #X_0# butcher gave her a liver and some dog bones for free. Angry at the husband and son who mistreated her so blatantly, he instructed her to not give them any of the meat.

-- #X_0# --
A country fellow who discovered the woman in the woods a day or two after she died. Too frightened to look closely at the corpse, the hunter hurried into town and brought a group of men—including the narrator and his brother—to see what he thought was the body of a beautiful young girl.

-- #X_0# --
A newsboy who abandoned his paper route to go see the body in the woods.

-- #X_0# --
A large man with a Civil War injury who took charge of the party of men.

-- #X_0# --
The owner of the livery barn where several townsmen (including the narrator) encountered #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
An aging writer, honorable, fastidious, and repressed, of high public status in #Y_0#. He travels to #Y_1# and stays in a hotel where the beautiful boy #X_1# is also a guest. As he gives way to his repressed sexuality and falls in love with #X_1# while embracing beauty and the sensual side of art, he also abandons morality and dignity, abandoning himself to passion, decadence, and ultimately death.

-- #X_0# --
An intensely beautiful Polish boy of about fourteen. He stays with his mother, sisters, and governess at the same hotel in #Y_0# as Gustav von #X_2#. #X_0#is pure and innocent but also aware of #X_2#'s interest in him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s closest companion at the hotel. He seems to idolize #X_1#, acting as his "vassal." #X_0# has glossy black hair, a sturdy build, and a rowdy temperament, serving as a polar opposite to #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the novel. #X_0# is a nondescript, unexceptional man. He admires those with high social standing, and conforms his values and behavior to their rules. #X_0# has a penchant for formalizing every human relationship. In his official work, he is careful to remove all personal concerns from consideration. In his private life, he adopts a fixed attitude toward his family.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s sick nurse and the butler's assistant. In this novel, #X_0# serves as a foil to #X_1#: healthy, vigorous, direct, he is everything that #X_1# is not. Unlike the other characters, #X_1# understands that unpleasantness and unpredictability are a part of life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s closest friend and fellow judge. Although he only appears in chapter I, #X_0# serves as a representative of #X_2#'s social milieu. He tends to view his relationships with people as instrumental to the achievement of his ends, and he goes to great lengths to avoid what is discomforting. Nevertheless, #X_0# is somehow more open to the truth than the other characters.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s wife and the mother of his children. #X_0#'s behavior toward others is artificial and self-interested. While feigning sympathy and concern for #X_2# during his illness, her real attitude is one of hostility and impatience for his death.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s colleague and friend. #X_0# is a well-dressed, playful, thoroughly proper man. He ignores life's unpleasantness. At #X_1#'s funeral, he is immune to all depressing influences and maintains his jovial and lighthearted demeanor. #X_1# mentions that #X_0# reminds him very much of his former self, and thus it is clear that #X_0# is a kind of double for #X_1#. The fact that "#X_0#" is German for "black," hints at #X_2#'s belief in the emptiness and ultimate demise of such an attitude toward life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s son. #X_4# is the youngest member of the #X_2# household. Sensitive and quiet, #X_4# has not yet been corrupted by the beliefs and values of his parents' social world. He is capable of forming empathetic bonds with other people, and he is the only other person, besides #X_1#, who truly understands #X_3# and his condition.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s daughter. #X_0# is very much like her mother. Selfish and easily annoyed, #X_0# resents any influence that distracts her from her own contentment. Her father's suffering inconveniences her more than anything else.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s fiancé. #X_0# is a typical member of his society. There is nothing remarkable or noteworthy about his character.

-- #X_0# --
An insecure, self-deluded traveling salesman. #X_0# believes wholeheartedly in the American Dream of easy success and wealth, but he never achieves it. Nor do his sons fulfill his hope that they will succeed where he has failed. When #X_0#’s illusions begin to fail under the pressing realities of his life, his mental health begins to unravel. The overwhelming tensions caused by this disparity, as well as those caused by the societal imperatives that drive #X_0#, form the essential conflict of Death of a Salesman.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s thirty-four-year-old elder son. #X_0# led a charmed life in high school as a football star with scholarship prospects, good male friends, and fawning female admirers. He failed math, however, and did not have enough credits to graduate. Since then, his kleptomania has gotten him fired from every job that he has held. #X_0# represents #X_2#’s vulnerable, poetic, tragic side. He cannot ignore his instincts, which tell him to abandon #X_2#’s paralyzing dreams and move out West to work with his hands. He ultimately fails to reconcile his life with #X_2#’s expectations of him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s loyal, loving wife. #X_0# suffers through #X_2#’s grandiose dreams and self-delusions. Occasionally, she seems to be taken in by #X_2#’s self-deluded hopes for future glory and success, but at other times, she seems far more realistic and less fragile than her husband. She has nurtured the family through all of #X_2#’s misguided attempts at success, and her emotional strength and perseverance support #X_2# until his collapse.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s thirty-two-year-old younger son. #X_0# has lived in #X_2#’s shadow all of his life, but he compensates by nurturing his relentless sex drive and professional ambition. #X_0# represents #X_3#’s sense of self-importance, ambition, and blind servitude to societal expectations. Although he works as an assistant to an assistant buyer in a department store, #X_0# presents himself as supremely important. Additionally, he practices bad business ethics and sleeps with the girlfriends of his superiors.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s next-door neighbor. #X_0# owns a successful business and his son, #X_1#, is a wealthy, important lawyer. #X_2# is jealous of #X_0#’s success. #X_0# gives #X_2# money to pay his bills, and #X_2# reveals at one point, choking back tears, that #X_0# is his only friend.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_2#’s son and an important, successful lawyer. Although #X_3# used to mock #X_0# for studying hard, #X_0# always loved #X_3#’s sons dearly and regarded #X_1# as a hero. #X_0#’s success is difficult for #X_3# to accept because his own sons’ lives do not measure up.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s wealthy older brother. #X_0# has recently died and appears only in #X_1#’s “daydreams.” #X_1# regards #X_0# as a symbol of the success that he so desperately craves for himself and his sons.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s mistress when #X_2# and #X_1# were in high school. #X_0#’s attention and admiration boost #X_3#’s fragile ego. When #X_1# catches #X_3# in his hotel room with #X_0#, he loses faith in his father, and his dream of passing math and going to college dies.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s boss. #X_0# inherited the company from his father, whom #X_1# regarded as “a masterful man” and “a prince.” Though much younger than #X_1#, #X_0# treats #X_1# with condescension and eventually fires him, despite #X_1#’s wounded assertions that he named #X_0# at his birth.

-- #X_0# --
A waiter at #Y_0#. #X_0# and #X_3# seem to be friends, or at least acquaintances, and they banter about and ogle Miss #X_2# together before #X_1# and #X_4# arrive at the restaurant.

-- #X_0# --
Two young women whom #X_4# and #X_2# meet at #X_3#’s #Y_0#. It seems likely that #X_0# are prostitutes, judging from #X_4#’s repeated comments about their moral character and the fact that they are “on call.”

-- #X_0# --
A serial murderer who builds #Y_0#. #X_0# is a sociopath who does not feel any empathy. His only goal is to revel in power and possession, which he does by manipulating people through seduction and money.

The most powerful monarch in Europe, whose court #X_2# visits.

-- #X_0# --
A German nobleman at the emperor’s court. The knight is skeptical of #X_2#’s power, and #X_2# makes antlers sprout from his head to teach him a lesson. The knight is further developed and known as #X_1# in B-text versions of Doctor #X_2#; #X_1# seeks revenge on #X_2# and plans to murder him.

-- #X_0# --
A candidate for the papacy, supported by the emperor. #X_0# is captured by the pope and freed by #X_1#. #X_0# appears only in B-text versions of Doctor #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A German nobleman whom #X_2# visits.

-- #X_0# --
Friends of #X_1# who reluctantly join his attempt to kill #X_2#. #X_0# appear only in B-text versions of Doctor #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the play and the wife of #X_2#. #X_0# initially seems like a playful, naïve child who lacks knowledge of the world outside her home. She does have some worldly experience, however, and the small acts of rebellion in which she engages indicate that she is not as innocent or happy as she appears. She comes to see her position in her marriage with increasing clarity and finds the strength to free herself from her oppressive situation.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s husband. #X_0# delights in his new position at the bank, just as he delights in his position of authority as a husband. He treats #X_2# like a child, in a manner that is both kind and patronizing. He does not view #X_2# as an equal but rather as a plaything or doll to be teased and admired. In general, #X_0# is overly concerned with his place and status in society, and he allows his emotions to be swayed heavily by the prospect of society’s respect and the fear of society’s scorn.

-- #X_0# --
A lawyer who went to school with #X_3# and holds a subordinate position at #X_3#’s bank. #X_0#’s character is contradictory: though his bad deeds seem to stem from a desire to protect his children from scorn, he is perfectly willing to use unethical tactics to achieve his goals. His willingness to allow #X_2# to suffer is despicable, but his claims to feel sympathy for her and the hard circumstances of his own life compel us to sympathize with him to some degree.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s childhood friend. Kristine #X_0# is a practical, down-to-earth woman, and her sensible worldview highlights #X_2#’s somewhat childlike outlook on life. #X_0#’s account of her life of poverty underscores the privileged nature of the life that #X_2# leads. Also, we learn that #X_0# took responsibility for her sick parent, whereas #X_2# abandoned her father when he was ill.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s best friend. #X_0# stands out as the one character in the play who is by and large unconcerned with what others think of him. He is also notable for his stoic acceptance of his fate. Unlike #X_2# and #X_1#, #X_0# admits to the diseased nature (literally, in his case) of his life. For the most part, he avoids talking to #X_2# about his imminent death out of respect for #X_2#’s distaste for ugliness.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# and #X_4#’s three small children. In her brief interaction with her children, #X_3# shows herself to be a loving mother. When she later refuses to spend time with her children because she fears she may morally corrupt them, #X_3# acts on her belief that the quality of parenting strongly influences a child’s development.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_2#’ nanny. Though #X_3# doesn’t fully develop her character, #X_0# seems to be a kindly woman who has genuine affection for #X_5#. She had to give up her own daughter in order to take the nursing job offered by #X_5#’s father. Thus, she shares with #X_5# and Mrs. #X_4# the act of sacrificing her own happiness out of economic necessity.

-- #X_0# --
Though #X_0# is dead before the action of the play begins, the characters refer to him throughout the play. Though she clearly loves and admires her #X_0#, #X_1# also comes to blame him for contributing to her subservient position in life.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s tragicomic hero. #X_0#’s main quest in life is to revive knight-errantry in a world devoid of chivalric virtues and values. He believes only what he chooses to believe and sees the world very differently from most people. Honest, dignified, proud, and idealistic, he wants to save the world. As intelligent as he is mad, #X_0# starts out as an absurd and isolated figure and ends up as a pitiable and lovable old man whose strength and wisdom have failed him.

-- #X_0# --
The peasant laborer—greedy but kind, faithful but cowardly—whom #X_1# takes as his squire. A representation of the common man, #X_0# is a foil to #X_1# and virtually every other character in the novel. His proverb-ridden peasant’s wisdom and self-sacrificing Christian behavior prove to be the novel’s most insightful and honorable worldview. He has an awestruck love for #X_1# but grows self-confident and saucy, ending the novel by advising his master in matters of deep personal philosophy.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s barn horse. #X_0# is slow but faithful, and he is as worn out as #X_1# is.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s donkey. #X_0#’s disappearance and reappearance is the subject of much controversy both within the story and within the literary criticism concerning #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The fictional writer of Moorish decent from whose manuscripts #X_1# supposedly translates the novel. #X_1# uses the figure of #X_0# to comment on the ideas of authorship and literature explored in the novel and to critique historians. #X_0#’s opinions, bound in his so-called historical text, show his contempt for those who write about chivalry falsely and with embellishment.

-- #X_0# --
The unseen force driving all of #X_2#’s adventures. #X_0#, a peasant woman whom #X_2# envisions as his ladylove, has no knowledge of his chivalric dedication to her. Though constantly mentioned and centrally important to the novel, she never appears as a physical character.

-- #X_0# --
The supposed translator of #X_1#’s historical novel, who interjects his opinions into the novel at key times. #X_0# intentionally creates the impression that he did not invent the character of Don #X_2#. Like #X_1#, #X_0# is not physically present but is a character nonetheless. In his prologues, dedications, and invention of #X_1#, #X_0# enhances the self-referential nature of the novel and forces us to think about literature’s purpose and limitations.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# cruel and haughty contrivers of the adventures that occupy #X_2# for the majority of the novel’s Second Part. Bored and snobby, the #X_0# and #X_0# feign interest in #X_2# and #X_3# but continually play pranks on them for their personal entertainment. #X_0# spend so much money and effort on their ploys that they seem as mad as #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The Duchess’s bratty maid. #X_0# pretends to love #X_1#, mocking his concept of romantic love.

-- #X_0# --
A sarcastic student from #X_1#’s village. #X_0# mocks #X_1# at first but loses to him in combat and then dedicates himself to revenge. Self-important and stuffy, #X_0# fails to grasp the often playful nature of #X_1#’s madness.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_1#. #X_0# disapproves of fictional books that, in his opinion, negatively influence society. Nonetheless, he enjoys tales of chivalry so much that he cannot throw them away. Moreover, despite his social conscience, he enjoys #X_1# madness  at times.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# friend who recognizes #X_2#’s  madness but intervenes only to help the priest carry out  his plans. #X_0# strenuously disapproves of #X_1# chivalry.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s good-hearted wife. #X_0# speaks in proverbs, exhibiting more wisdom than most other characters. Unambitious but a bit greedy, she endures #X_1#’s exploits and supports him with her prayers.

-- #X_0# --
An honorable man who is driven mad by the infidelities of his wife, #X_2#, and the treachery of a duke, #X_1#. #X_0# is the quintessential romantic lover.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s wife. Silent and beautiful, #X_0# is a model of the courtly woman. Docile and innocent, she obliges her parents and her lover.

-- #X_0# --
An arrogant young duke who steals #X_3# from #X_2# with no remorse.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s faithful and persistent love. #X_0# flouts tradition to hunt down #X_1# when he takes her chastity but refuses to marry her. Deceptive and cunning, smart and aggressive, #X_0# is not the typical female character of her time.

-- #X_0# --
A fictitious maidservant in distress who is impersonated by the Duke’s steward. The countess’s sob story sends #X_2# and #X_3# off on their expedition on the wooden horse. She is more ridiculous and fantastic than anyone except #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
An ungrateful galley slave whom #X_2# frees. #X_0# appears mostly for comic relief, but his justifications for his crimes force us to be more critical of #X_2#’s justifications for his crimes.

-- #X_0# --
A chivalrous bandit. Inherently conflicted, #X_0# believes in justice and generosity but kills an underling who challenges him for being so generous to others.

-- #X_0# --
A centuries-old vampire and Transylvanian nobleman, #X_0# inhabits a crumbling castle in the Carpathian Mountains. Beneath a veneer of aristocratic charm, the count possesses a dark and evil soul. He can assume the form of an animal, control the weather, and he is stronger than twenty men. His powers are limited, however—for instance, he cannot enter a victim’s home unless invited, cannot cross water unless carried, and is rendered powerless by daylight.

-- #X_0# --
A Dutch professor, described by his former pupil Dr. #X_3# as “a philosopher and metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day.” Called upon to cure the ailing #X_2#, #X_0#’s contributions are essential in the fight against #X_1#. Unlike his comrades, #X_0# is not blinded by the limitations of Western medicine: he knows that he faces a force that cannot be treated with traditional science and reason. Knowledgeable about vampire folklore, #X_0# becomes #X_1#’s chief antagonist and the leader of the group that hunts #X_1# down and destroys him.

-- #X_0# --
A solicitor, or lawyer, whose firm sends him to Transylvania to conclude a real estate transaction with #X_1#. Young and naïve, #X_0# quickly finds himself a prisoner in the castle and barely escapes with his life. He demonstrates a fierce curiosity to discover the true nature of his captor and a strong will to escape. Later, after becoming convinced that the count has moved to #Y_0#, #X_0# emerges as a brave and fearless fighter.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# fiancée. #X_0# is a practical young woman who works as a schoolmistress. Eventually victimized by #X_2# herself, #X_0# is also the best friend of the count’s first victim in the novel, #X_4#. #X_0# is in many ways the heroine of the novel, embodying purity, innocence, and Christian faith—virtues she maintains despite her suffering at the vampire’s hands. She is intelligent and resourceful, and her research leads #X_5# men to Castle #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s best friend and an attractive, vivacious young woman. The first character in the novel to fall under #X_2#’s spell, #X_0# becomes a vampire, which compromises her much-praised chastity and virtue, and banishes her soul from the promise of eternal rest. Determined that such an end is unfit for an English lady of #X_0#’s caliber, #X_4# crew hunts down the demon she has become and kills it, following the rituals of vampire slaying, and thus restoring #X_0#’s soul to her body and to heaven.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s fiancé and a friend of her other suitors. #X_0# is the son of Lord #X_2# and inherits that title upon his father’s death. In the course of his fight against #X_1#’s dark powers, #X_0# does whatever circumstances demand: he is the first to offer #X_3# a blood transfusion, and he agrees to kill her demonic form.

-- #X_0# --
A talented young doctor, formerly #X_5# pupil. #X_0# is the administrator of an insane asylum not far from #X_2#’s English home. Throughout the novel, #X_0# conducts ambitious interviews with one of his patients, #X_4#, in order to understand better the nature of life-consuming psychosis. Although #X_3# turns down #X_0#’s marriage proposal, his love for her remains, and he dedicates himself to her care when she suddenly takes ill. After her death, he remains dedicated to fighting the count.

-- #X_0# --
A plainspoken American from #Y_0#, and another of #X_3#’s suitors. #X_0# proves himself a brave and good-hearted man, never begrudging #X_2# his success in winning #X_3#’s hand. #X_0# ultimately sacrifices his life in order to rid the world of #X_1#’s influence.

-- #X_0# --
A patient at #X_1#’s mental asylum. Variously a strong behemoth and a refined gentleman, #X_0# indulges a habit of consuming living creatures—flies, spiders, birds, and so on—which he believes provide him with strength, vitality, and life force.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother. A brittle woman of failing health, #X_0# inadvertently sabotages her daughter’s safety by interfering with #X_2# folk remedies. She dies of shock when a wolf leaps through #X_1#’s bedroom window.

-- #X_0# --
A respected doctor and friend of both #X_3#, a fellow physician, and #X_4#, a lawyer. #X_0# is a seemingly prosperous man, well established in the community, and known for his decency and charitable works. Since his youth, however, he has secretly engaged in unspecified dissolute and corrupt behavior. #X_0# finds this dark side a burden and undertakes experiments intended to separate his good and evil selves from one another. Through these experiments, he brings Mr. #X_2# into being, finding a way to transform himself in such a way that he fully becomes his darker half.

-- #X_0# --
A strange, repugnant man who looks faintly pre-human. #X_0# is violent and cruel, and everyone who sees him describes him as ugly and deformed—yet no one can say exactly why. Language itself seems to fail around #X_0#: he is not a creature who belongs to the rational world, the world of conscious articulation or logical grammar. #X_0# is #X_2#’s dark side, released from the bonds of conscience and loosed into the world by a mysterious potion.

-- #X_0# --
A prominent and upstanding lawyer, well respected in the #Y_0# community. #X_0# is reserved, dignified, and perhaps even lacking somewhat in imagination, but he does seem to possess a furtive curiosity about the more sordid side of life. His rationalism, however, makes him ill equipped to deal with the supernatural nature of the Jekyll-Hyde connection. While not a man of science, #X_0# resembles his friend Dr. #X_2#—and perhaps Victorian society at large—in his devotion to reasonable explanations and his denial of the supernatural.

-- #X_0# --
A reputable #Y_0# doctor and, along with #X_4#, formerly one of #X_3#’s closest friends. As an embodiment of rationalism, materialism, and skepticism, #X_0# serves a foil (a character whose attitudes or emotions contrast with, and thereby illuminate, those of another character) for #X_3#, who embraces mysticism. His death represents the more general victory of supernaturalism over materialism in #X_0# #X_3# and Mr. #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s butler. #X_0# is a loyal servant, having worked for the doctor for twenty years, and his concern for his master eventually drives him to seek #X_2#’s help when he becomes convinced that something has happened to #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A distant cousin and lifelong friend of #X_0# #X_2#. Like #X_2#, #X_0# is reserved, formal, and scornful of gossip; indeed, the two men often walk together for long stretches without saying a word to one another.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s clerk and confidant. #X_0# is also an expert in handwriting. His skill proves particularly useful when #X_3# wants him to examine a bit of #X_1#’s handwriting. #X_0# notices that #X_1#’s script is the same as #X_2#’s, but slanted the other way.

-- #X_0# --
A well-liked old nobleman, a member of #Y_0#, and a client of #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The title character and protagonist of the novel. The son of a once-wealthy man who became an alcoholic and committed suicide. After his mother's death, #X_0# was cared for by his uncle #X_2#. #X_0# becomes a doctor and a writer and serves in World War I. He marries #X_4#, and they have two children, but he falls in love with #X_3# while working in a military hospital.

The widow of a Belgian engineer, she settles in #Y_0# with her daughter #X_1# and son #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s brother. He attends a military academy and becomes a soldier.

-- #X_0# --
A lawyer who drove the elder #X_4# to suicide. He assisted the #X_2# out of loyalty to #X_1# deceased husband. He preys on the young #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The oldest daughter of the #X_0# family. #X_0# is one of the most eligible young women in #Y_0# society circles. Though she wants to marry and have children, she struggles to connect with acceptable suitors, as her easygoing attitude leads most men to see her as a friend rather than a romantic prospect. She is beautiful, intelligent, and outspoken. #X_0# is mostly proper though she is not afraid to step outside the traditional female roles established by society and is willing to throw a punch when necessary. #X_0# values the love and closeness of her large family and desires a match based on romantic connection rather than necessity.

-- #X_0# --
The Duke of Hastings and best friend of #X_1#. Formerly known as Earl #X_2#, following the death of his father #X_0# assumes the title of the Duke of Hastings. #X_0# is handsome, strong, and quiet. He is viewed as the most eligible match for the young women of #Y_0# though he has vowed never to marry. #X_0# is prone to fits of anger and brooding behavior stemming from his father’s rejection of him as a child due to his faltering speech. His anger toward his father has fueled his educational success and eloquence though he sometimes stutters when he is extremely upset. Though he is reputed to be a rake, much of that reputation is based on exaggeration.

-- #X_0# --
The oldest son of the #X_0# family and best friend of #X_2#, the Duke of Hastings. #X_0# becomes the man of the #X_0# house following his viscount father’s death. He takes this role seriously, vetting #X_1#’s suitors and occasionally allowing her input regarding her potential husbands. #X_0# is attractive and physically intimidating. His quick anger is motivated by love and a desire to protect his family.

-- #X_0# --
The viscountess and loving mother of eight #X_0# children. Like the other Ambitious Mamas of #Y_0# society, #X_0# dedicates herself to finding a suitable husband for her daughter #X_1#. Unlike most, however, she wants her children to marry for love as she did with their late father. #X_0#’s kindness and warmth accompany a quick wit and a fierce desire to protect her children.

-- #X_0# --
The third-oldest #X_0# child who is 18 months older than #X_2#. #X_0# and #X_2# have shared a close bond and a tendency for trouble since childhood. #X_0# is strong and handsome like the other #X_0# men, though he tends to be more relaxed than his older brothers. #X_0# enjoys travel and adventure, and he is not yet ready to settle down with a wife. #X_0# is mischievous and good-natured, though he is also committed to the well-being of #X_2# and the rest of the family.

-- #X_0# --
The second-oldest #X_0# child. #X_0# shares the #X_0# good looks and fierce love of family. He does not enjoy society events, though his respect for his mother compels his attendance, and he is hot-tempered particularly when defending #X_1#’s honor.

-- #X_0# --
The former Duke of Hastings and father of #X_0# #X_0#. The Duke of Hastings is an unpleasant and selfish man who cares only for his bloodline and reputation. His rejection of #X_0# due to his young son’s delayed speech and stutter fuels the younger #X_0#’s drive to succeed and haunts him until long after the duke’s death.

-- #X_0# --
The author of #X_0#’s Society Papers. Though the character never appears in the novel, her published writings frame the narrative. Her commitment to gossip and her caustic wit can build or crush reputations and enhance or destroy lives. Her true identity is unknown.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a submissive junior hit man who is constantly bossed around by #X_1#. Both #X_0# and #X_1# are protagonists of the play, but the audience, also limited in knowledge, sees the play from #X_0#'s point-of-view, and empathizes more with him. #X_0# is more sensitive, has a conscience about his job, and is bored by the stale routine of his lower-class life. He also questions the inner workings of their job more, especially with regards to the mysterious #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the senior hit man, the dominant foil to his submissive partner #X_1#. He runs their outfit, but pays strict attention to the demands of #X_2#, their boss. He often broods silently, reads the newspaper, doesn't question their job, and evades #X_1#'s probing questions.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a mysterious figure, the boss of #X_2# and #X_1#. He never shows up but the messages from the dumb waiter may be from him. He may also own the café in which the play is set. Regardless of his physical reality or lack thereof, he plays an important role in the other characters' minds.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of Dune. #X_0# is the son of Duke Leto #X_0# and is the heir to the House of the #X_0#. At the beginning of the novel, #X_0# is fifteen years old. He has been trained from birth to fulfill the role of duke, and he is adept at combat and strategic thinking. #X_0# is also a quiet, thoughtful, and observant young man. #X_0# is not overly tall or muscular, but he is strong and quick. Among the Fremen, #X_0# has two names: Usul, which signifies strength, and #X_2#, the name of the desert mouse on Arrakis.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s mother. #X_0# is the concubine of Duke #X_1# Atreides. Though she acts like a wife to #X_1# and he has no other concubines, she is not married to #X_1#. #X_0# is a member of #Y_0#, a school that teaches and practices what many others think of as witchcraft. An orphan who never knew her parents, #X_0# is tall and slender, with bronze-colored hair and green eyes.

-- #X_0# --
#X_5#’s father. #X_0# is the head of the House of #X_0# and the rightful ruler of #Y_0#. The duke received #Y_0# from the emperor in exchange for #X_0#’s own planet of Caladan, which was given to the duke’s mortal enemy, Baron #X_2#. The duke is a wise, intelligent, and compassionate man, but he is ruthless when it comes to dealing with his enemies. He cares very much for his concubine, #X_3#, and their son, #X_5#.

-- #X_0# --
Leader of the House of #X_0#. The baron is the mortal enemy of #Y_0#. The baron is very fat, and his bulk is supported by electronic suspenders.

-- #X_0# --
Nephew of Baron #X_0#. #X_0# is the baron’s first choice for an heir. The baron hopes to secure a vast amount of power for the #X_0# family before #X_0# comes into his inheritance. #X_0# is nearly the same age as #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# #X_2#, a human trained to think logically, rationally, and mathematically to be the perfect adviser. #X_0# is ambitious and scheming, two emotional traits that are unusual and not desired  in a #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_2#’s doctor. #X_0# betrays the #X_2# to the #X_3#. His betrayal is particularly shocking because at this time, doctors of #Y_0# are supposed to be heavily psychologically conditioned to never cause harm.

-- #X_0# --
The son of Cyrus #X_0# and the father of #X_2# and #X_4#. #X_0# is a goodhearted but somewhat impractical man, and his innocence leads him to fall in love with the novel’s most evil character, #X_5#. In the novel’s retelling of the biblical story of #X_3# and #X_1#, #X_0# plays the #X_1# role in the first generation of the #X_0# family; in the second generation, he plays the #X_0# role befitting his name. #X_0#’s benediction to #X_4# at the end of the novel validates timshel, the idea that individuals are free to choose their own moral paths.

-- #X_0# --
The son of Cyrus #X_0# and the half-brother of #X_1#. #X_0# is a violent, cynical, manipulative man who works his father’s farm and greedily amasses a large fortune. Although #X_0# is deeply jealous of his brother, he also needs #X_1# and misses him terribly when he is not at home. #X_0# plays the #X_2# role in the first generation of the #X_0#s. He is one of the only characters capable of inspiring fear in the thoroughly evil #X_3#.

As a result, #X_0# weakens and increasingly retreats into the church as a protection from the harsh realities of the world. #X_0# plays the #X_1# role in the second generation of the #X_0# family. When #X_4# (the corresponding #X_3#) reveals to #X_0# that their mother, #X_5#, is a prostitute, #X_0# is so devastated that he leaves #Y_0# and joins the army, and soon dies in World War I.

The son of #X_2# and #X_6# and the twin brother of #X_3#. #X_5# is a manipulative, tempestuous boy who is fiercely jealous of his more likable brother, #X_3#. #X_5# struggles throughout the second half of the novel to control his temptations and to lead a moral life. Ultimately, he accepts the idea of timshel, that every individual is free to choose his own moral path in life. This acceptance enables #X_5# to overcome his fear that his mother’s evil has been passed down to him. At the end of the novel, #X_5# is the character who most directly embodies this central idea of timshel. #X_5# plays the #X_4# role in the second generation of the #X_0# family, indirectly killing #X_3# (the corresponding #X_1#) by revealing to #X_3# that their mother is a prostitute, which leads #X_3# to join the army and die in World War I. When his father confronts him about #X_3#’s whereabouts, #X_5# sneers, “Am I supposed to look after  him?”—an echo of #X_4#’s famous retort to #X_7#, “Am I my brother’s keeper?”

A moral monster, the most evil character in the novel. #X_6# acts out of a perverse love of debasement, destruction, and control.

She later marries and then shoots #X_2#, abandoning her newborn twin sons in order to return to prostitution. After murdering the brothel owner, #X_8#, #X_6# becomes the madam of the brothel, using drugs to control and manipulate her whores. She takes photographs of powerful men involved in sadomasochistic sex acts in order to blackmail them. #X_3#’s discovery that #X_6# is his mother shatters him and spurs the chain of events that leads to his death. #X_6# represents #X_7# in the #X_4# and #X_1# story of the novel, introducing sin and evil into the world. She commits suicide after enduring #X_3#’s response to her. (For the sake of consistency, this SparkNote refers to her as #X_6# throughout, though at various points in the novel she goes by the name #X_5# or #X_9# as she attempts to cover her identity.)

The daughter of the corrupt county supervisor in #Y_0#. #X_0#, who is as goodhearted as #X_3# is evil, offers compassion and common sense to the tumultuous #X_4# family. #X_0# falls in love with #X_1#, but after his cowardly withdrawal into the church, she shifts her affections to #X_2#. Like #X_2#, #X_0# worries that her father’s corruption—the narrator implies that he steals money and that he is one of the men whom #X_3# blackmails—will taint her. However, with #X_2#, #X_0# learns the lesson of timshel—that she is free to choose her own moral destiny.

A man who runs a prostitution ring throughout #Y_2# and #Y_0#. #X_0# has a highly moral wife and a pair of sons who attend the prestigious #Y_1#, and he leads a largely respectable life despite his base profession. After employing #X_2# as a prostitute, #X_0# falls in love with her.

The protagonist and narrator of the memoir. #X_0# grows up isolated from mainstream society in a strict Mormon household, and grapples with her upbringing when she later pursues her education.

When #X_0# realizes that #X_2# has also been abused by #X_1#, she finds a sense of independence. For a brief time, #X_0# is angry and wants her family to know what #X_1# has done. However, #X_0# is not strong enough to stand up for herself, and quickly caves into family pressure. #X_0# is much more traditional and submissive than her sister, and because she has not been educated, she cannot think for herself in the same way.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s brother. #X_0# is the closest to #X_1# in age, and is also quite intelligent. He attends college, and eventually gets a PhD. #X_0# also maintains a relationship with #X_1# after she becomes estranged from her family, but she is less close with him than she is with #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s oldest brother. Although he tries to live a more independent life, he ends up working for his father.

The new girl in high school, and one of the novel’s two protagonists. #X_0# is “big and awkward,” has curly red hair, and often dresses in men’s clothing with wild accessories, all of which make her stand out in a crowd. #X_0# is extremely smart and brave, but she is also prickly and tends not to let people get too close to her. She puts up walls around herself as a self-defense mechanism because she has experienced a lot of pain and abuse in her life, and it takes a long time for her to trust other people enough to let her guard down and be herself.

-- #X_0# --
An artistic Asian-American high schooler, and one of the novel’s two protagonists. #X_0# knows how to get along with the other kids at his school, but he doesn’t really fit in with them. #X_0# tends to retreat to his own world by listening to headphones or reading comic books. He also feels like an outsider among the men in his family, since he is small, likes to wear black, and would rather listen to music than play football. #X_0# knows how to get along with others, and throughout the book, he gains the confidence to start asserting what he wants.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s evil stepfather. #X_0#is domineering, self-centered, and mean. He is physically, emotionally, and psychologically abusive to everyone in the household, but particularly to #X_1# and her mom. #X_0#is an alcoholic, and he can launch into a violent rage at the smallest provocation. If things don’t go exactly as #X_0#wants them to go, and even if #X_0#hasn’t told anyone what he wants, he will lash out at everyone. He has to be the center of attention at all times, and treats everyone around him like they’re his property.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother, a kind but worn-down woman. #X_0# is very beautiful, but she is not confident in herself. She tries to pretend that everything at home is all right, even though #X_2# abuses her and doesn’t respect the family. #X_1#’s mother always wants to smooth things over and make things seem like they’re okay instead of standing up for herself in difficult situations. She is sweet to #X_1# and tries to take care of her, but she also isn’t a person that #X_1# feels like she can turn to for emotional support.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s mother, a beautician who grew up in #Y_0# and immigrated to #Y_1# when she married #X_2#’s father. #X_2#’s mother wants to assimilate into American culture, which is why she goes by “#X_0#” instead of her #Y_0#n given name, “#X_1#.” She is doll-like in appearance, and she takes pride in being neat and pretty. #X_0# sometimes has a difficult time seeing beyond the surface, but eventually, when she gets to know people, she appreciates them.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s father, a kindhearted army veteran who takes pride in being a man’s man. #X_0# met #X_1#’s mother when he was stationed in #Y_0#, and they still have an openly affectionate relationship. #X_1#’s parents gives #X_1# a good role model for a healthy, caring adult relationship. #X_0# is sometimes hard on #X_1# because he wants his sons to be masculine, and he has trouble understanding #X_1#’s artistic side, but ultimately, #X_0# stands up for his family.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s younger but taller brother. #X_0# is more stereotypically masculine than #X_1#, and he fits into these social roles much more easily than #X_1# does. #X_1# sometimes feels like his dad compares him to #X_0# and is disappointed in #X_1# as a result.

-- #X_0# --
The oldest of #X_1#’s younger siblings. #X_0# is twelve and old enough to recognize how terrible #X_2# is to the family, but he’s also terrified of #X_2#. Even though he used to be on #X_1#’s side against #X_2#, now he feels distant from her. Since she ran away without saying goodbye, he doesn’t know if he can trust her, even though she’s always loved all of her siblings.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s nine-year-old little sister. #X_0#, like #X_2#, also used to be allied with #X_3# against #X_4#, but in the year when #X_3# went away, #X_0# started calling #X_4# “Dad.” #X_0# is scared of #X_4#, but she’s still too young to understand the full extent of #X_4#’s abuse, and she doesn’t yet know how to stand up to #X_4#.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#’s younger brothers. #X_0#is the only one of #X_1#’s siblings who seems genuinely happy to see her when she comes back. However, #X_0#is only five.

-- #X_0# --
An absent figure in #X_0# life. #X_0# dad abandoned #X_1# and the rest of her family, and he has very little contact with them. He has started a whole new life with a son and a fiancée. #X_1# certainly doesn’t feel like she can turn to him to help her deal with the terrible #X_2# situation, because even when #X_2# kicked her out of the house, #X_1# didn’t attempt to live with her dad.

-- #X_0# --
The popular girl at school, and a bully. #X_0#picks on #X_2# because #X_2# doesn’t fit in. #X_0#is jealous of #X_2# because #X_0#used to date #X_3# and she still has feelings for him. To retaliate, she coordinates some cruel pranks against #X_2# in the gym locker room. #X_3#’s mother likes #X_0#because #X_0#is conventionally beautiful and enjoys getting makeovers. However, despite being a bully, #X_0#helps #X_2# at the end of the novel when #X_4# becomes a real threat.

-- #X_0# --
The alpha male at school, and a bully. #X_0#drinks, smokes pot, and is generally loud and obnoxious. He leads the taunting on the school bus. Even though #X_2# has known him for years and doesn’t like him, #X_0#usually leaves #X_2# alone. The first time that #X_2# ever retaliates against #X_0#is when #X_0#is taunting #X_1#. But at the end of the novel, #X_0#helps #X_1# escape from #X_3#, since he’s mean but not fundamentally evil.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_3#’s friends at school. #X_0#sometimes says racist things to #X_3#, but they come out of ignorance, rather than out of a desire to insult #X_3#. #X_0#’s main concern is trying to date #X_2#, and he wants #X_3# to be his wingman. Even though #X_3# gets along with #X_0#, he doesn’t feel any kind of deep bond with him, and #X_0#is much more interested in himself than in what #X_3# is going through in his relationship with #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s crush at school. #X_1# tries to use #X_3# to help him win #X_0#’s heart, but #X_3# is more concerned with his relationship with #X_2# than with the dynamic between #X_1# and #X_0#. #X_0#is a foil to #X_2#, since she is a nice and very normal girl who fits in well at school, but she doesn’t appear to have a very deep or unusual personality.

-- #X_0# --
One of the girls in #X_1#’s gym class who befriends #X_1#. In many ways, #X_0# seems like #X_1#’s physical opposite. She is a tiny African-American girl who looks like she could be a gymnast, and she is engaged to a boy who’s already graduated from high school, which helps to give her confidence when other people tease her. Like #X_1#, however, #X_0# also dresses unusually, and she accepts #X_1# for who she is.

One of the girls in #X_2#’s gym class who befriends #X_2#. #X_0# is even bigger physically than #X_2#, but #X_0# doesn’t get picked on like #X_2# does. #X_0# and #X_1# have been best friends since grade school, and #X_2# feels honored that they’ve taken her under her wing. Even though many people at school are cruel to #X_2#, she has managed to find a few friends that see her for who she is.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s guidance counselor. #X_0#is one of the few adults in #X_1#’s life who appreciates #X_1# for who she is and seems to care about #X_1# as a person. #X_1# almost feels like she can open up and tell #X_0#all about her terrible home life, but she doesn’t want to overstep her relationship or seem like she’s complaining, so instead, she keeps things bottled in. However, #X_0#knows that #X_1# gets picked on in gym class, and she is somewhat of a safe haven for #X_1# at school, even if #X_1# doesn’t open up to her completely.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# and #X_2#’s English teacher. #X_0# recognizes #X_1#’s talent for poetry recitation, and he singles her out in class to praise her. #X_2# first realizes that #X_1# is talented when she recites poems, and #X_0#’s class gives #X_1# and #X_2# the opportunity to find experiences through literature that help expand their worldview beyond their high school.

#X_1# Irish parents who live next door.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the eldest daughter of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon. Poorly treated by her mother and her mother's husband, Aegisthus, she spends her days mourning her father's murder and awaiting the return of her brother, #X_1#, whom she believes will help her to carry out that which she most longs for: vengeance for her father's death. She is stubbornly devoted to the principles of justice, reverence, and honor, although oftentimes her grasp on these principles seems questionable.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the son of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon, and therefore, he is the rightful king of Argos. Saved as a young child by Electra and smuggled away to Phocia after Agamemnon's murder, he has now returned to Mycenae to avenge his father's death, as instructed by the oracle of Apollo. He is advised and accompanied by his tutor and keeper, the Old Man, and his silent friend, Pylades. Still a youth, #X_0# is somewhat naïve and inexperienced. He acts because he has been so instructed by Apollo's oracle, and not as motivated by intense or deep emotion.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the Queen of Argos. Formerly married to Agamemnon, whom she murdered, she now reigns corruptly alongside Aegisthus, her paramour. She despises and poorly treats her daughter, Electra, whose constant mourning and desire for revenge threatens #X_0#. She loves wealth and well being, both of which she enjoys, but she is clearly haunted by her past actions and aware that her current happiness rests on uneasy ground.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the younger daughter of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon. Although she recognizes her mother's corruption and although she understands the injustice of her father's murder, she refuses to mourn in the way that her sister, Electra, does. She realizes that she will gain the greatest benefits by siding with those in control. Unlike Electra, who adheres to the principles of justice, #X_0# clings to the principle of expediency in the hopes of maximizing her own comfort and profit.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# is the faithful servant to whom #X_3# entrusted #X_4# as a young boy. The #X_0# smuggle #X_4# to Phocia, where he served as the boy's tutor and guardian. A voice of wisdom and practicality, he acts as #X_4#' advisor in exacting revenge for #X_2#'s death, paying strict attention to detail, focus, and timing.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the paramour of Clytemnestra and responsible for the murder of Agamemnon. Like Clytemnestra, he is aware of the uneasy foundations upon which his position rests. His great desire is to eliminate threats to his way of life; always cruel to Electra, he wants to lock her away along with her perpetual grieving, and he celebrates #X_1#' supposed death.

-- #X_0# --
The chorus is comprised of the virgins of the palace. Traditionally reserved and conservative, this chorus abandons its conventional stance to whole-heartedly support both #X_1# and the play's final act of vengeance.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_1#'s silent friend who accompanies him and the Old Man to Mycenae to exact revenge for Agamemnon's death. He is the mute witness to the play's drama in much the same way that the audience is.

At the end of the book, #X_0# convinces #X_2# to go with her to colonize the bugger worlds, and she works on a history of the world on the way there. Later she travels with #X_2# as he searches for a new world for the buggers.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s older brother #X_0# is a cruel and evil child, gifted in manipulation. He has the same ruthlessness that his siblings contain but without any of their compassion. #X_4# is able to protect #X_1# as best she can from #X_0# until #X_1# goes away. #X_0# then decides to take an active role in world affairs and convinces #X_4# to help him.

He is one of the few characters who at various times allows #X_2# to act like the child he is, although #X_0# also demands much of #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s last teacher, #X_0# makes no attempt to become #X_1#'s friend, although, like #X_2#, he loves and respects the boy. #X_0# is forced to deceive #X_1# into thinking he is playing mere games and explains to him that no one but a child could have won the war—it took both compassion, daring, and ruthlessness that he himself could not have had since he knew it was not a game.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_1#'s enemy and was the commander of #Y_0#. His pride cannot accept the fact that #X_1# is smarter and better than him, and this makes him cruel. His honor forces him to fight #X_1# man-to-man, and #X_0# is killed in that fight.

-- #X_0# --
A high military official, he takes interest in #X_2# and questions #X_3# as to how he will bring him along. #X_0# points out that the children at #Y_0# do not act like normal children, and #X_3# says that they are not.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the protagonist of the play, though his unlikable demeanor at times makes him the antagonist to his servant, #X_1#. Blind, immobilized by old age in his wheeled chair, #X_0# believes no one suffers more than he does. To him, there is no cure for being on earth, especially not in the dank hole where he also rules over his father, #X_2#, and mother, #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the other protagonist of the play, the servant to #X_1# despite his own infirmity. He was taken in by #X_1# as a child, and the play's tension pits #X_0#'s desire to leave against his obligation to stay with #X_1# (an obligation he questions many times). He performs various tasks for his master, such as wheeling him around and reporting on the landscape outside the windows.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_2#'s husband and #X_1#'s father. Contained in an ashbin next to his similarly trapped wife, he emerges now and then to cry for food or to try unsuccessfully to kiss #X_2# and tell her the same story he always tells. At times he is childlike, barely verbal, but he can be profound and articulate.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_2#'s husband and #X_1#'s mother. She seems most resigned to their lives of routine, calling the daily attempt to kiss #X_2# a "farce." Though her part is minimal, she seems to be the one reason #X_2# keeps living and stands as the sole example of healthy love in the play.

-- #X_0# --
A practicing medical doctor, the medical officer of the town baths, and the brother of the mayor, who got him the job at the baths. #X_0# is idealistic and excitable.

-- #X_0# --
Dr. #X_0#'s wife. She is loyal and practical and often encourages her husband to think of his family when he is being rash. #X_2# is her adoptive father, or grandfather, depending on translation.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of #X_2# and #X_1#, #X_0# is as idealistic as her father. She is a hard-working teacher, and she is frustrated that the law requires her to teach things she doesn't believe in.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is Dr. #X_0#'s brother. He is also chairman of the baths committee. He is a cautious but sometimes ruthless politician.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is editor of #Y_0#, the town's leftist newspaper. Although slightly corrupt, he is at heart a political radical.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the newspaper's printer. Because he lets the paper print on credit, he has a degree of editorial control. He is also the chairman of the homeowners association, which represents the town's small business class, the majority of voters. He also has great influence with #Y_0#, and he is a lover of moderation.

-- #X_0# --
An assistant at the newspaper, he is a radical, like #X_1#, but he is also ambitious and plans to run for office. He is in some way courting #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A ship captain who has little interest in local politics, #X_0# provides the hall for Doctor #X_1#'s speech, but he is fired from his ship as a result.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the novel and the English patient of the title. #X_0#is knowledgeable and reflective, the "blank screen" upon which the other characters reflect their thoughts and wishes. Though he is badly burned in a plane crash, he retains all his mental faculties and is able to tell #X_3#, #X_5#, and #X_2# the pieces of his past and the story of how he fell in love with #X_4#. #X_0#strongly believes that nations are dangerous inventions, and that love can transcend both time and geography.

-- #X_0# --
A young Canadian who serves the Allies as a nurse in World War II. Only twenty years old, #X_0#is an excellent nurse who takes good care of her patients. She has quickly learned that she must not become emotionally attached to her patients, as she has seen too many young soldiers slip out of her life. Very close to her father, #X_0#had an emotional breakdown when she heard the news of his death. She falls in love with the idea of the English patient, of the thought that she is caring for a saint-like man. Her heart, however, belongs to #X_2#, to whom she looks for protection as she stands at the boundary between adolescence and adulthood.

-- #X_0# --
A Sikh man from #Y_0# who works as a "sapper," defusing bombs for the British forces in World War II. First introduced only as "the sikh," #X_0#is polite and well-mannered, and has both the skill and character to be an excellent sapper. A brown man in a white nation, #X_0#has grown emotionally detached, aware that people will not always react positively to him. His emotional detachment stands in the way of his relationships, most significantly his relationship with #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A Canadian thief whose profession is legitimized during the war when he puts his skills to use for the British intelligence effort. #X_0#, whom we first know only as "the man with bandaged hands," proves endearing despite the fact that his actions are not always virtuous. #X_1# remembers that, in his burglaries, #X_0# was always distracted by "the human element"—an Advent calendar that was not open to the right day, for example. #X_0# serves as a kind of surrogate father to #X_1#, and sheds light on the identity of the English patient.

-- #X_0# --
An #Y_1#-educated woman and the wife of #X_2# #X_0#. One of the most mysterious characters in the novel, #X_0# is never fully understood. We know that she married #X_2# quite young and traveled with him to Northern Africa, and that she is an avid reader who voraciously learns all she can about #Y_0# and the desert. Though polite and genteel, #X_0# nevertheless takes what she wants, assertively approaching #X_1# and telling him that she wants him to "ravish her." Though #X_2# is a devoted and kind husband, #X_0# never seems remorseful about her extramarital affair. We see #X_0#'s wild, dark side in her affair with #X_1#, as she punches and stabs her lover, angry at him for refusing to change and daringly challenging the world to recognize their relationship.

-- #X_0# --
A British explorer and #X_3# #X_0#'s husband. A young, good-natured, affable man, #X_0# is a new addition to the group of explorers who are mapping the North African desert. #X_0# seems to have everything going for him: an #Y_1# education, wealthy family connections, and a beautiful young wife. He is a proud and devoted husband, and enjoys praising his wife in front of the other explorers. #X_2# claims to have come to North Africa purely out of an interest in exploration, but #X_1# finds out that #X_0# has been working for #Y_0# as an aerial photographer. Everyone seems to like #X_0#, but #X_3#, who knows him best, knows his capacity to be insanely jealous.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s best friend in the desert. #X_0# is a rational, level-headed man who, like #X_1#, chose to live in the desert to study the features of the land and report back to #Y_0#. Unlike #X_1#, #X_0# includes his own emotional reactions in his writing and reports, and is not shy to describe his amazement at a particular mountain or his wonder at the size of the moon. #X_0# always carries a copy of Anna Karenina, the famous tale of adultery, but remains ever faithful to his wife back home. #X_0# sees the church as proclaiming a jingoistic pro-war message during World War II. He takes his own life in the church, and #X_1# concludes that he "died because of nations."

-- #X_0# --
A member of the old English aristocracy who, once the war begins, takes it upon himself to defuse bombs and train other men to do so. #X_0# is the one "true English gentleman" whom #X_2# meets while he is abroad. Though #X_0# is described as strange and eccentric, #X_2# finds that he is actually a wonderful man and a kind mentor. #X_2# especially values the fact that #X_0# can look beyond his race and welcome him into the "English family." The nobleman's death is a large loss in #X_2#'s life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s father, the only parent who was present to raise her while she was growing up. Like #X_1#, #X_0#leaves #Y_0# to join the war effort. #X_1# is extremely close to her father, and the news of his death sparks her initial emotional breakdown. She takes comfort in the fact that he died in a "holy place," a dove-cot.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s stepmother and #X_2#'s wife. #X_0# does not appear in the novel as a character, but #X_1# thinks of her occasionally, remembering her in a canoe on the lake she loves so much. Despite her absence, #X_0# plays an important role in the novel because, to #X_1#, she symbolizes home, the place she has escaped from but the place to which she longs to return at the end of the novel.

-- #X_0# --
The title character and protagonist of the story. #X_0# is about to turn thirteen years old and is the beloved only child of #X_3# and Ramona #X_0#. She is sheltered from the harder realities of those who work on her father’s ranch, #Y_0#. Her life revolves around pretty clothes, celebrations, and the affection of her parents and grandmother, #X_1#. She is smart and stubborn, and finds comfort in daydreams and fantasies until she gains the strength and courage to adapt to her new life when tragedy strikes.

The bond of their three generations becomes a crucial part of their survival.

-- #X_0# --
A worker on #Y_1# and later on the #Y_0# farm. He is the son of #X_2# and #X_4# and lifelong friend to #X_3#. Handsome and funny, #X_0# is sixteen years old, strong, eager to learn, and realistic about the work he must do to better his life and that of his family. His relationship with #X_3# is sometimes strained by their different social status, and he is frustrated when #X_3# cannot see past it. #X_0# calls #X_3# his “queen.”

-- #X_0# --
A migrant field worker and #X_2#’s antagonist. #X_0# is sixteen years old, strong-willed, intelligent, and charismatic. She speaks English as well as Spanish, unlike many of the workers. She is confident and consistently speaks up for the rights of the workers, urging them to unionize. She challenges #X_2#’s assumptions of the workers in general, and taunts #X_2# about her new circumstances.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s grandmother and mother to #X_3# (Mama). #X_0# is loving, eccentric, patient, and clever. She is a calming influence before and after the events that change #X_2#’s life. No stranger to upheaval, #X_0# shares lessons through stories. #X_2# enjoys crocheting with #X_0# and hearing her stories, as well as learning from her courage and adaptability.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father, a wealthy landowner and rancher in #Y_0#, #Y_1#. Admired and respected by his workers, #X_3# adores his daughter. He tries to teach #X_2# from a young age to listen and feel for the heartbeat of the land and to live patiently and with hope for the future, whatever it brings. #X_3# dies at the beginning of the novel, which sets the rest of the plot’s events in motion.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s father. He is the lead worker on #Y_0#. He is loyal to #X_1#’s family and offers advice, caution, and connections that provide a way forward for #X_1# and #X_2# after tragedy.

They are field workers, and #X_2# and her mother become part of their extended family in #Y_0# when they move into part of their cabin. #X_0# have three children but welcome #X_2# and her mother warmly. They are content yet pragmatic workers, willing to share whatever they can.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# and #X_2#’s daughter. #X_0# is eight years old, kind-hearted, and patient. She helps #X_1# adjust in #Y_0#, teaching her how to do housework, take care of children, and understand the complex social arrangements of the different worker groups. She is content with what she has but begs #X_1# to tell her stories of her former life, with its parties, beautiful clothes, and dolls.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4# and #X_3#’s young twins. Once #X_2# goes to school, #X_1# takes care of the twins until she is old enough to work. The children bond immediately with #X_1# and bring her a bit of joy and confidence.

-- #X_0# --
Field workers in #X_1#’s camp. Older than #X_1#, they spend time with her often, working and taking care of children. #X_0# is also from #Y_0# and knows about #X_1#’s family, though from the perspective of her friends among the ranch’s workers. #X_1# feels closer to #X_0# because she is younger than #X_0#, but #X_0# is also mature and a calm mother to her own little child.

-- #X_0# --
A migrant field worker and #X_2#’s mother. A gentler presence than her daughter, she joins #X_2# in the workers’ strikes, though #X_2# is concerned for her safety.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s best friend. She spends time with #X_1# and #X_2# in the field workers’ camp.

-- #X_0# --
A field worker. She shares news from other field workers’ camps with #X_1#’s group.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# stepbrothers. They inherit #Y_0# because women cannot inherit property. #X_0# is the local bank president and #X_0# is the town’s mayor. #X_0# is fond of both #X_2# and the possibilities of owning the ranch, but the cruelty that simmers underneath his surface is also a threat to both.

-- #X_0# --
An egg seller on #X_1#’s train to #Y_0#. #X_0# is poor but happy, and she is talkative as the family travels. #X_2# describes her as an example of kindness to those even worse off than she is.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the story, #X_0# is a farmer whose family has lived and died on the same #Y_0# farm for generations. A sensitive figure, #X_0# has a deep, almost mystical appreciation of nature, and he feels a strong connection to the youth, beauty, and vital spirit of #X_1#, his wife’s cousin. However, he ultimately lacks the inner strength necessary to escape the oppressive forces of convention, climate, and his sickly wife.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s sickly wife, more commonly known as “#X_2#.” She comes across as prematurely aged, caustic in temperament, prone to alternating fits of silence and rage, and utterly unattractive, making her the novel’s least sympathetic figure. She is acutely interested in the treatment of her own illness, displaying a degree of hypochondria (imagined illness or minor symptoms secretly relished and exaggerated by the patient). Despite #X_2#’s apparent physical weakness, she, not #X_1#, holds the dominant position in their household.

-- #X_0# --
#X_5#’s cousin, who comes to assist the #X_3# with their domestic tasks. Attractive, young, and energetic, #X_0# becomes the object of #X_2#’s affection, and reciprocates his infatuation. Because the reader sees #X_0# only through #X_2#’s own lovesick eyes, #X_0# never truly emerges as a well-rounded character. She often seems more a focus for #X_2#’s rebellion against #X_5# and #X_4# than an actual flesh-and-blood person with both strengths and weaknesses.

-- #X_0# --
Although he recounts the story’s events, the narrator (an engineer by profession) plays no part in the story itself. That he remains nameless highlights the thinness of his character. As a stranger to #Y_0#, he views #X_1# story with fresh eyes and operates as a conduit between the closely guarded story of #X_2#’s tragedy and the reader in the world outside the novel.

-- #X_0# --
The son of #Y_0#’s rich Irish grocer, Michael #X_0#, and sometime-suitor of #X_2# Silver. #X_0# is the focus of #X_1#’s jealousy in the novel’s early chapters, before #X_1# learns of #X_2#’s true feelings.

-- #X_0# --
Widow of #X_0# #X_0# and landlady to the unnamed narrator. The narrator describes #X_0# #X_0# as more refined and educated than most of her neighbors. Although she was once intimate with the #X_1#, she hesitates to discuss their plight with her inquisitive lodger.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4# Varnum’s fiancé and later her husband. #X_0# and #X_4#’s romance contrasts with the fruitless love of #X_2# and #X_3#. #X_0# has died by the time the narrator comes to #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father, #X_0# is an amiable builder involved in regular business dealings with the young #X_1#. When #X_1# requests that #X_0# extend him an advance on a lumber load, #X_0# is forced to politely refuse, citing his own financial constraints. Nevertheless, #X_1# (mistakenly) continues to regard him as a possible source of a loan.

-- #X_0# --
#X_5#’s mother and #X_0#’s wife, #X_0# #X_0# extends an unexpected degree of warmth to #X_3# after encountering him by chance one winter afternoon. Her kindness and praise for his dedication to #X_6# lead #X_3# to reevaluate his decision to borrow money from #X_0# #X_0# to elope with #X_4#.

-- #X_0# --
The hired man on the #X_2# farm. #X_0#’s main duty is to assist #X_1# in the cutting, loading, and hauling of lumber. Markedly reticent, #X_0# is sensitive to the tensions between the #X_2#s but loath to involve himself in them.

-- #X_0# --
A former stage-driver and town gossip. #X_0# provides the narrator with a scattering of details about #X_1# Frome’s life and later suggests that the narrator hire #X_1# as a driver, paving the way for the relationship through which the narrator learns #X_1#’s story.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator of the story. #X_0# describes herself as a big-boned woman with hands that are rough from years of physical labor. She wears overalls and has been both mother and father to her two daughters. Poor and uneducated, she was not given the opportunity to break out of her rural life. A loving mother, her frank, open nature prevents her from deluding herself when it comes to her daughters’ weaknesses. #X_0# has a strong understanding of her heritage and won’t allow #X_1# to take the family quilts.

-- #X_0# --
The shy, retiring daughter who lives with Mama. Burned in a house fire as a young girl, #X_0# lacks confidence and shuffles when she walks, often fleeing or hanging in the background when there are other people around, unable to make eye contact. She is good-hearted, kind, and dutiful. Rather than anger her intimidating sister, she is willing to let #X_1# have the quilts that had originally been promised to her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s older daughter, who has renamed herself #X_3#. #X_0# wears a brightly colored, yellow-and-orange, ankle-length dress that is inappropriate for the warm weather. Her hair stands up straight on top and is bordered by two long pigtails that hang down in back. #X_0# is educated, worldly, and deeply determined, not generally allowing her desires to be thwarted. When #X_2# won’t let her have the quilts to display, she becomes furious. She claims that #X_2# and #X_1# don’t understand their heritage, but she is the one overlooking the important aspects of her family history.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s boyfriend or, possibly, husband. #X_0# is a Black Muslim whom #X_3# humorously refers to as Asalamalakim, the Arab greeting he offers them, meaning “peace be with you.” An innocuous presence, he is a short and stocky, with waist-length hair and a long, bushy beard. His desire to make a good first impression makes him seem awkward. He makes #X_2# uncomfortable by forcing his attention and greetings on her.

-- #X_0# --
the unnamed protagonist of the novel. He is dead at the opening of the novel. He is married three times, and each marriage ends due to his affairs with other women. Only one of his three children, his daughter #X_1#, has a good relationship with him. #X_0# works as a successful art director at a well-regarded advertising firm in #Y_0#, before retiring early out of ill health. He is deeply afraid of the oblivion that faces him after death. However, throughout multiple surgeries on his arteries, the #X_0# tries to maintain a stoic, accepting outlook on life, particularly to reassure those around him.

-- #X_0# --
the protagonist’s older brother. It is through #X_0#’s eulogy to the everyman that we first learn of the everyman’s childhood and the factors which shaped his outlook on life. Loving, kindly, and loyal, #X_0#, unlike his brother, remains married to one woman his whole life and stays on good terms with his four sons. #X_0# rises up the ranks at #Y_0# to become a very wealthy and successful man, and uses his money to look after the everyman in any way he can.

-- #X_0# --
The everyman’s only daughter by his second wife, #X_1#. The everyman views #X_0# as a pure force of good, though at times her naïve belief in the goodness of others leads her into poor judgement. Her weak, order-loving husband left her in the chaos after the birth of their twins. She is one of the few female characters to remain beside the everyman even as his behavior leads him towards isolation.

-- #X_0# --
The everyman’s second wife, and the mother of #X_1#.  Candid, unaffected and with an elegant but straightforward, almost child-like beauty, #X_0# is the woman the everyman most regrets losing. Having suffered from severe migraines, #X_0# is able to deal in a calm and reassuring manner with the everyman’s own illnesses. After she suffers a debilitating stroke, the everyman regrets the loss of her eloquent manners of speech, even though she also used it to express her anguish and humiliation at his affairs.

-- #X_0# --
the everyman’s day nurse. Buxom, brash and kindly, #X_0# carries on an affair with the everyman and lends the everyman her vitality and sexual strength to help him recover from a serious operation and the death of his father. She enjoys the stares of men and is unafraid of the judgements of #X_1#, the everyman’s wife at the time.

-- #X_0# --
the everyman’s third and final wife. #X_0# is beautiful, vain and utterly unable to provide the everyman with the support he needs during his illness. #X_0# is a young model when the everyman, still married to #X_1#, begins their affair. In their early days #X_0#’s daring self-possession and stunning good looks are a source of power to the everyman, but after they are married, the negative side of #X_0#’s character emerges, such as her financial debts, her morbid fear of sickness, and her weakness under pressure.

-- #X_0# --
the everyman’s oldest son by his first wife #X_1#. Like his brother #X_2#, he harbors a deep and intractable hatred for the father who left him, #X_2# and their mother. Both he and #X_2# are unable to understand that they are not the only people in the world to experience hardship. They are both described as handsome men beginning to thicken with age.

-- #X_0# --
the everyman’s second son by his first wife #X_1#. Like his brother #X_2#, he hates his father. The everyman believes that #X_0# and #X_2# hate him to the point that they would relish his death, though we see this is not the case by both #X_0# and #X_2#’s awkwardness at the funeral. #X_0# is distinguishable from #X_2# only by his hesitation to drop a clod of earth on the everyman’s grave as they both stand beside it.

-- #X_0# --
the everyman’s first wife, and #X_4# and #X_2#’s mother. #X_1# barely appears in the novel and is mostly described in relation to other two wives. She is prone to angry outbursts. The everyman leaves her for the more stable and #X_5# #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
the night nurse supplied by #X_3# after one of the everyman’s operations.  #X_0# is a large black woman with the bearing of #X_2#. At night, #X_0# tells the everyman stories about her life as a child on the avocado farm in her lovely West Indian-accented voice.

-- #X_0# --
one of the everyman’s painting students at the retirement community and recent widow of Gerald #X_0#. She is above average in her artistic abilities and reminds the everyman of #X_3# in her appearance. Unlike #X_3#, #X_0# is unable to face illness and mortality. Feeling lonely and humiliated by her physical and mental weakness, she kills herself. She serves mostly to spur the everyman into facing mortality and to thinking through (and ultimately rejecting) the idea of suicide.

He quickly forms unusually strong attachments with anyone who seems receptive to true friendship. His biggest regret in life is not having a better relationship with his wife.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s brittle, sickly-looking wife. She is obsessed with watching television and refuses to engage in frank conversation with her husband about their marriage or her feelings.

Small-minded and childish, #X_0# does not understand her husband and apparently has no desire to do so.

-- #X_0# --
The captain of #X_1#’s fire department. Although he is himself extremely well-read, paradoxically he hates books and people who insist on reading them. He is cunning and devious, and so perceptive that he appears to read #X_1#’s thoughts.

-- #X_0# --
A retired English professor whom #X_1# encountered a year before the book opens. #X_0# still possesses a few precious books and aches to have more. He readily admits that the current state of society is due to the cowardice of people like himself, who would not speak out against book burning when they still could have stopped it. He berates himself for being a coward, but he shows himself capable of acts that require great courage and place him in considerable danger.

-- #X_0# --
A beautiful seventeen-year-old who introduces #X_1# to the world’s potential for beauty and meaning with her gentle innocence and curiosity.

One of #X_1#’s friends. Like #X_0# #X_2#, she does not seem to care deeply about her own miserable life, which includes one divorce, one husband killed in an accident, one husband who commits suicide, and two children who hate her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s younger brother. #X_0# depends on his older brother, who acts as a father figure to him and enlists in #Y_0# in part to help support him. Yet #X_1# seems to need #X_0# just as much as #X_0# needs him. #X_0#’s dependence on #X_1# and his admiration and love for him act as #X_1#’s only solid link to the civilian world during the war and provide him with his only sense of purpose.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
A member of #X_2#’s squad. Jewish and possibly homosexual, #X_0# is the target of prejudice nearly as frequently as the black soldiers, to whom he pledges his support in racial skirmishes. #X_0# is a devoted fan of the movies, and he distances himself from the horror of battle by imagining that he is merely playing a role in a war film.

A soldier of Italian descent on #X_1#’s squad. #X_0# seems slightly braver than the rest, always taking the dangerous position of point man.

An army nurse #X_1# meets during the trip to #Y_0#. Though #X_1# sees #X_0# only once more before learning of her death, she serves as the closest thing to a love interest in the novel, and she is a source of confusion and tame fantasy for #X_1#.

The novel’s narrator and protagonist. A young American ambulance driver in the Italian army during World War I, #X_0# meets his military duties with quiet stoicism.

His life lacks real passion until he meets the beautiful #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
An English nurse’s aide who falls in love with #X_1#. #X_0# is exceptionally beautiful and possesses, perhaps, the most sensuously described hair in all of literature. When the novel opens, #X_0#’s grief for her dead fiancé launches her headlong into a playful, though reckless, game of seduction. Her feelings for #X_1# soon intensify and become more complicated, however, and she eventually swears lifelong fidelity to him.

-- #X_0# --
A surgeon in the Italian army. Mischievous, wry,  and oversexed, #X_0# is #X_1#’s closest friend. Although #X_0# is a skilled doctor, his primary practice is seducing beautiful women. When #X_1# returns to #Y_0#, #X_0# tries to whip up a  convivial atmosphere.

-- #X_0# --
A kind, sweet, young man who provides spiritual guidance to the few soldiers interested in it. Often the butt of the officers’ jokes, the #X_0# responds with good-natured understanding.

-- #X_0# --
A spry, ninety-four-year-old nobleman. The count represents a more mature version of #X_3#’s character and #X_2#’s masculine ideal. He lives life to the fullest and thinks for himself.

-- #X_0# --
An American soldier from #Y_0#. #X_0#, like #X_1#, fights for the Italian army. Unlike #X_1#, however, #X_0# is an obnoxious braggart. Quick to instigate a fight or display the medals that he claims to have worked so hard to win, he believes in and pursues the glory and honor that #X_1# eschews.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father and the patriarch of the American branch of the #X_3# family. #X_0# is a first-generation Japanese immigrant with a strong sense of honor.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The American military man who questions #X_1# at #Y_0#, #Y_1#. The interrogator’s grilling of #X_1# on his personal history and his accusation that #X_1# supplied oil to Japanese submarines represents the #Y_2# government’s tendency to stereotype Japanese Americans as traitors.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The beautiful young woman at the center of the novel, who must choose among three very different suitors. She is the protagonist, propelling the plot through her interaction with her various suitors. At the beginning of the novel, she is penniless, but she quickly inherits and learns to run a farm in #Y_0#, where most of the novel takes place. Her first characteristic that we learn about is her vanity, and #X_1# continually shows her to be rash and impulsive. However, not only is she independent in spirit, she is independent financially; this allows #X_1# to use her character to explore the danger that such a woman faces of losing her identity and lifestyle through marriage.

-- #X_0# --
The novel's antagonist, #X_0# is a less responsible male equivalent of #X_2#. He is handsome, vain, young, and irresponsible, though he is capable of love.

The antagonist and title character of The Lord of the Rings. The Dark Lord #X_2#, a servant of #X_1#, the Great Enemy, took his master’s place after the First Age.

He fervently desires the One Ring, which he created long ago and which holds a great part of his power. #X_2# is wise, but he only thinks in terms of desire—especially desire for power. He therefore does not understand those who would want to destroy the Ring rather than use it—which is perhaps his only weakness.

A mysterious, gigantic, terrifying elemental demon from deep inside the earth. #X_0#, the “nameless fear” awakened by the Dwarves in the Mines of Moria, emerges from the depths when the Fellowship passes through the Mines, and it ultimately confronts #X_1# in an epic battle. #X_0#, which brandishes an enormous flaming sword and whip, is wreathed in flame and yet exudes shadow and darkness.

-- #X_0# --
Squat, swarthy, wretched creatures that are seemingly limitless in number and that serve the purposes of #X_2#. Hordes of #X_0#, which are unable to withstand daylight and therefore emerge almost exclusively at night, pursue the #Y_0# through the Mines of Moria and beyond; it is presumed that the #X_0# are also responsible for the death of #X_1# and the other Dwarves who returned to Moria in an attempt to reclaim the ancient Dwarf realm there.

-- #X_0# --
A swarthy, suspicious fellow in #Y_0# who appears to have been paid off by the Black Riders to watch Frodo’s movements. #X_0# sells the hobbits a half-starved pony at a high price to replace the ponies the Black Riders set loose the night before.

-- #X_0# --
The Master of Rivendell. #X_1# is descended from a Man and an Elf—thus, “Halfelven.” He had the choice to be mortal or immortal and chose the latter. As a consequence, #X_1# must leave Middle-earth when the time comes, most likely at the end of the War of the Ring. He is renowned for his wisdom and learning.

-- #X_0# --
The Lady of Lothlórien and perhaps the wisest of the Elves. #X_0# bears one of the Elven Rings of Power and uses it to read #X_3#’s mind. Like #X_2#, she sometimes appears as less a character than an embodiment of physical, mental, and spiritual perfection.

The husband of Galadriel. Celeborn and Galadriel, who both appear to be timeless, ageless beings, rule as Lord and Lady of Lórien, the Elvish forest.

-- #X_0# --
Another Elf-lord who attends the #Y_0# of Elrond. #X_0# suggests that the Ring be given to Tom #X_1#, over whom it has no power; the others at the #Y_0#, however, worry that even #X_1# could not single-handedly defeat #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The leader of the group of Elves who halt the #Y_0#’s entry into the forest of Lothlórien. #X_0# then leads the #Y_0# into the heart of the forest to meet #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The hero of The Hobbit and #X_3#’s cousin and mentor. #X_2# is clever and loves a good joke or song. The effects of having kept the Ring for so long only occasionally mar his thoughtfulness. #X_2# is an object of curiosity in the #Y_0# for his learning and his wandering ways, and he is trying to write a book detailing his many adventures.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of Fences, a fifty-three year-old, African American man who works for the sanitation department, lifting garbage into trucks. #X_0# is also a former baseball star in #Y_1#. #X_0#'s athletic ability diminished before #Y_0# accepted Black players. Hard-working, strong and prone to telling compelling, fanciful stories and twisting the truth, #X_0# is the family breadwinner and plays the dominant role in his over thirty-year friendship with fellow sanitation worker, #X_3#. #X_0#'s character is the centerpiece that all of the other relationships in Fences gather around. #X_0# is husband to #X_6#, father to #X_4#, #X_1#, and #X_5#, and brother to #X_2#. #X_0# is a tragic-hero who has excessive pride for his breadwinning role. #X_0#'s years of hard-work for only meager progress depress him. #X_0# often fails to provide the love and support that would mean the most to his loved ones.

-- #X_0# --
The teenage son of #X_5# and #X_3# #X_0#. A senior in high school, #X_0# gets good grades and college recruiters are coming to see him play football. #X_0# is a respectful son, compassionate nephew to his disabled Uncle #X_1#, and generally, a giving and enthusiastic person. An ambitious young man who has the talent and determination to realize his dreams, #X_0# comes of age during the course of the play when he challenges and confronts #X_5# and leaves home. #X_0# comes home from the Marines in the final scene of the play, attempting to defy #X_5# by refusing to go to his funeral, but #X_0# changes his mind after sharing memories of his father with #X_3# and #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#'s wife and mother of his second child, #X_2#. #X_0# is a forty-three year-old African American housewife who volunteers at her church regularly and loves her family. #X_0#'s request that #X_4# and #X_2# build a fence in their small, dirt backyard comes to represent her desire to keep her loved-ones close to her love. Unlike #X_4#, #X_0# is a realist, not a romantic longing for the by- gone days of yore. She has high hopes for her son, #X_2# and sides with him in his wish to play football. #X_0#'s acceptance of #X_4#'s illegitimate daughter, #X_3#, as her own child, exemplifies her compassion.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s brother. #X_0# was a soldier in the Second World War, during which he received a head injury that required a metal plate to be surgically implanted into his head. Because of the physical damage and his service, #X_0# receives checks from the government that #X_2# used in part to buy the #X_0#'s home where the play takes place. #X_0# wanders around the #X_0# family's neighborhood carrying a basket and singing. He often thinks he is not a person, but the angel #X_0# who opens the gates of heaven with his trumpet for Saint Peter on Judgment Day. #X_0# exudes a child-like exuberance and a need to please.

-- #X_0# --
#X_5#'s best friend of over thirty years. #X_0# is usually called "#X_0#" or "Mr. #X_0#" by the characters in Fences. #X_0# and #X_5# met in jail, where #X_5# learned to play baseball. #X_5# is a role model to #X_0#. #X_0# is the only character in Fences who remembers, first-hand, #X_5#'s glory days of hitting homeruns in #Y_0#. Less controversial than #X_5#, #X_0# admires #X_5#'s leadership and responsibility at work. #X_0# spends every Friday after work drinking beers and telling stories with #X_5# in the #X_3# family's backyard. He is married to a woman named #X_2#, who is friends with #X_4#. #X_0# is a devoted husband and friend. #X_0#'s concern for #X_5#'s marriage takes precedent over his loyalty to their friendship.

-- #X_0# --
#X_5#'s son, fathered before #X_5#'s time in jail with a woman #X_5# met before #X_5# became a baseball player and before he met #X_4#. #X_0# is an ambitious and talented jazz musician. He grew up without #X_5# for much of his childhood because #X_5# was in prison. #X_0#, like most musicians, has a hard time making a living. For income, #X_0# mostly depends on his girlfriend, #X_2# whom we never see on stage. #X_0# does not live with #X_5#, #X_4# and #X_3#, but comes by the #X_0# house frequently on #X_5#'s payday to ask for money. #X_0#, like #X_4#, plays the numbers, or local lottery. Their activity in the numbers game represents #X_4# and #X_0#' belief in gambling for a better future. #X_0#' jazz playing appears to #X_5# as an unconventional and foolish occupation. #X_5# calls jazz, "Chinese music," because he perceives the music as foreign and impractical. #X_0#' humanity and belief in himself garners respect from others.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#'s illegitimate child, mothered by #X_1#, his lover. #X_2# introduces #X_0# to the play as an infant. Her innocent need for care and support convinces #X_3# to take #X_4# back into the house. Later, #X_0# plants seeds in the once barren dirt yard. #X_0# is the only #X_0# child that will live with few scars from #X_4# and is emblematic of new hope for the future and the positive values parents and older generations pass on to their young.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s buxom lover from #Y_0# and #X_2#'s mother. #X_0# dies while giving birth. She symbolizes the exotic dream of #X_3#'s to escape his real life problems and live in an illusion with no time.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of #X_3# and sister of #X_2#. #X_0# is the first yellow fever patient that the #X_1# women see.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the play, #X_0# wants to belong to #Y_0#, his birthplace, having been raised in Athens and taught never to commit himself to anything by The Tutor. When he sees the servile life the #X_2# are living and meets his sister Electra, #X_0# decides to disobey the laws of the gods and murder Aegistheus and Clytemnestra to free the city. His strength lies in the recognition that he is free and can do what he thinks is right instead of following someone else's moral rules. Because he understands that moral values spring from human freedom and only he can judge whether his actions are right or wrong, #X_0# does not feel remorse and threatens the order of the gods.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the king of the gods. #X_1#'s most important antagonist, #X_0# represents the moral systems imposed on human beings by others. Wanting to maintain order, #X_0# has devoted his existence to ensuring that humanity fears him and will follow his laws. He supports Aegistheus and Clytemnestra, who maintain control of their city through fear. #X_0#'s weakness is that he has no power over those who know they are free and do not fear him. Intimidation is his only weapon, and as a result he cannot force #X_1# to atone for his crime.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s sister, #X_0# is both his companion and his foil. Mistreated by her mother Clytemnestra, #X_0# waits for the day when her brother will come to free her and avenge the murder of their father Agamemnon by Aegistheus. #X_0# spends her days in hatred of Clytemnestra and Aegistheus, who constantly punish her for refusing to repent for their crimes like the rest of the Argives. Since #X_0# fantasizes about her revenge, she cannot live with the actual act. Having helped #X_1# kill Aegistheus and Clytemnestra, #X_0# turns against him, repents of the murders, and surrenders to Jupiter.

-- #X_0# --
King of Argos, #X_0# killed Agamemnon fifteen years ago and took his throne. To maintain power, #X_0# cultivated a deep sense of remorse in the people of Argos. Making everyone complicit in Agamemnon's murder because he could not accept the guilt by himself, #X_0# forces his subjects to repent for the crime he committed. In his attempt to hold on to power, however, #X_0# has lost his soul. He sees himself only as his subjects see him and does not know who he is. Agamemnon represents the Nazi occupation of #Y_0# during World War Two.

-- #X_0# --
Previously Agamemnon's wife and now married to Aegistheus, the queen has helped her husband maintain the atmosphere of remorse. She is generally quiet and does not play a major part in the play. #X_0# hates her daughter Electra and does not attempt to protect her from Aegistheus. In the Greek myth, Orestes's most horrifying crime was the murder of his mother. #X_1# is less concerned with matricide than he is with free action in general, and he downplays #X_0#'s presence to show this shift in emphasis. In her silent approval of the king's policies and her complicity in his murder of the rightful king, #X_0# represents the #X_2# government of #Y_0#, which collaborated with the Nazi conquerors.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# raised and educated #X_2#. He has taught him to always be skeptical of all morals and irrational beliefs. #X_0# believes that he has given #X_2# complete freedom by teaching him to avoid commitments and attachments to others. #X_2# finally rejects this as a false view of freedom. #X_3# believes that human beings create themselves and their values through free action. #X_0#'s notion of freedom is a freedom from action rather than true freedom, which is the freedom to act and create. Though #X_0# is instrumental in helping #X_2# live for the future rather than remaining stuck in the past like the #X_1#, #X_2# has to move beyond this false freedom before he can become a true human being.

-- #X_0# --
Unlike the #X_0# of Greek myth who punished crimes against family, #X_4#'s #X_0# are the goddesses of repentance. Until #X_3# and #X_2# commit their murder, the #X_0# manifest themselves as flies. #X_0#y are everywhere in the city, biting its inhabitants to punish them for their sins. #X_0# #X_1# welcome the flies and demand to be punished for their crimes. In speaking with #X_2#, the #X_0# confound love with hatred: they hate sinners and punish them, but they do so out of love in order to help the sinners atone for their crimes.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#helps to maintain the repressive atmosphere of repentance set up by Aegistheus. He is the symbol of religious moral authority just as the king represents political moral authority. #X_0#appears only once in the play to lead the ceremony of the dead. He calls on the dead to punish the living for all of the suffering they had inflicted. When Jupiter causes the stone to move in order to silence Electra, the #X_0# shouts that this is the vengeance of the dead, and that the Argives must repent for having listened to the temptress.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# appears only at the very start of the play. He sits stupidly in the square while flies suck on the pus leaking out of his eyes. #X_0# represents the ideal of the Argives: completely passive and willing to take his punishment without complaint.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# are the men and women of Argos who completely accept their submission to Aegistheus. #X_0#y live in repentance for all their sins, never speaking out and avoiding all action that could displease the gods. #X_0# publicly admit their sins and judge one another. Aegistheus has attempted to make his subjects feel that his eyes are on them all the time, judging them even in their private moments. #X_0#, completely unaware that they are free, do not realize the service #X_1# has done them by killing their oppressive rulers. Fear and repentance have taught them to always look for external judgment so that they will never think of looking within themselves and finding their own freedom.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# obey the king. They are his enforcers, but rarely have any need to act because the #X_1# are so obedient. A scene in the middle of the play involves the soldiers in a farcical interlude, designed to mock the power of the throne they are guarding and the solemnity of the moral system Aegistheus has imposed on them. Though the soldiers speak very seriously of the dead, their comments are calculated to bring out the absurdity of the repressive system in which people are afraid of invisible spirits judging and punishing them.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist and author of the progress reports that form the text of Flowers for Algernon. #X_0# is a thirty-two-year-old intellectually disabled man who lives in #Y_1#. At the start of the novel, he works at #Y_0# as a janitor and delivery boy. #X_0#’s friendliness and eagerness to please, along with his childhood feelings of inadequacy, make him the hardest-working student in #X_1# literacy class for intellectually disabled adults. When #X_0# undergoes an experimental surgery to increase his intelligence, his IQ skyrockets to the level of a genius. His obsession with untangling his own emotional life and his longing to reach an emotional maturity and inner peace to match his intellectual authority inform many of the novel’s primary concerns.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s teacher at #Y_0#. #X_0# originally recommends #X_1# for the experimental operation because she is impressed by his motivation. Although she is not one of the scientists who perform the experiment on #X_1#, she acts as an unofficial member of the team because of her concern for him. She is interested in intellectual pursuits but is ultimately more motivated by emotion. #X_0# is the one woman with whom #X_1# briefly finds loving fulfillment.

-- #X_0# --
The scientist in charge of the experiment that heightens #X_2#’s intelligence. An arrogant and career-obsessed man, #X_0# treats #X_2# as a laboratory animal rather than a human being. #X_0# has a tendency to imply that he created #X_2#, as if his intellectually disabled patient is not a human. #X_0# is tormented somewhat by his wife, who seems even more fixated on his career than he is.

-- #X_0# --
The neurologist and psychiatrist who performs the experimental operation that raises #X_2#’s intelligence, and #Y_0#’s partner in the experiment. #X_0# conducts therapy sessions with #X_2# after the operation. Unlike #Y_0#, #X_0# maintains interest in and concern for #X_2#’s emotional development.

-- #X_0# --
A friendly graduate student who is working on his thesis and who assists #X_4# and #X_3# in conducting the experiment. #X_0# oversees the testing of both #X_2# and #X_1#. He introduces #X_2# to some of the students and faculty at #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --

She embarks on a brief affair with #X_1#, knowing nothing about his background.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s mother, a domineering woman terribly ashamed of #X_2#’s intellectual disability. In the early part of his childhood, #X_0# refused to accept that #X_2# was abnormal, despite her husband’s appeals for her to be rational. #X_0# finally had another child, #X_3#, on whom she focused all of her energy. #X_0# routinely punished #X_2# for any sign of sexual interest, as she could not accept the notion of her intellectually disabled son having any form of sexuality.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s father, a barbershop-supply salesman who always wanted to open his own barbershop, and eventually does. Although #X_0# tried to protect the young #X_1# from #X_2#’s hostility, he gave in too easily to her bullying.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s younger sister, who grows up to act as caretaker for their mentally unstable mother. During their childhood, #X_0# resented #X_2# for getting what she perceived as special treatment and was cruel to him. When she reencounters #X_2# as an adult, however, she is glad to see him and regrets her youthful spite.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s uncle, who took care of #X_2# after #X_3# expelled him from her home. #X_0# was generous to #X_2#, protected him from neighborhood bullies, and set him up with his longtime job at #Y_0#. At the beginning of the novel, #X_0# has been dead for years.

-- #X_0# --
The owner of the bakery where #X_1# works. A friend of Uncle #X_2#, #X_0# agreed to hire #X_1# so he would not have to go to #Y_0# upon #X_2#’s death. #X_0# gave #X_2# his word that he would look out for #X_1#’s interests. #X_0# stands by his pledge faithfully and treats #X_1# like family.

-- #X_0# --
Two employees at #Y_0# who often pick on #X_2#. #X_0# and #X_0# play tricks on #X_2# and make him the butt of jokes that he does not understand. However, #X_0# and #X_0# think of themselves as #X_2#’s friends and defend him when others pick on him.

-- #X_0# --
A baker at #Y_0# who secretly steals from his boss. #X_0# got his nickname because of his limp. His relationship with #X_1# is much like #X_2# and #X_3#’s relationship with #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The only bakery employee who is consistently nice to #X_1#. #X_0# does not like to see the others pick on #X_1# because of his disability. When #X_1# becomes a genius, #X_0# is glad for him but is highly suspicious and wonders if he has made a deal with the devil.

-- #X_0# --
A quack doctor to whom #X_2# was taken as a child. #X_0# promised #X_3# that he could scientifically increase #X_2#’s intelligence, but his methods are a complete sham. #X_0#, however, was kind to #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A brutish new employee at #Y_0# who is working there when #X_1# briefly reassumes his job after losing his temporary intelligence.

-- #X_0# --
The play's protagonist. Dressed in cowboy gear from head to toe, #X_0# is a larger than life, multi-dimensional character. Some of his traits are not larger than life but ordinary weaknesses. For instance, he is an overly proud man with a drinking problem. #X_0# is emblematic of the symbol he believes in. He believes in the myths of the idyllic American West, the cowboy as a hero who saves the day, and the American Dream of country living. #X_0# habitually entangles himself in volatile romances. His passionate, competitive nature magnifies itself when he drinks and when he relates to his lovers #X_2# and "the Countess." He has trouble distinguishing between reality and fiction, lies and truth though he would not admit this. #X_0# has a strange but complicit relationship with his father, the #X_4# character in the play who exists only in #X_2# and #X_0#'s minds. #X_0# shares his love of liquor with the #X_4# and seems to share the same sense of humor. #X_0#'s character contains autobiographical elements of #X_5# life. He wrote Fool for Love after leaving his wife, #X_3#, for movie actress, #X_1# and has a complicated past with his heavy-drinking father.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s lover. Simultaneously strong-willed and vulnerable, #X_0# lives alone in a seedy motel room on the outskirts of the Mojave Desert. #X_0# is a good match for #X_1# in that she can keep up with his verbal gymnastics and power plays. She can make #X_1# as jealous as he makes her and she can reject #X_1# just as powerfully as he does her. On the flipside, #X_0# longs for #X_1# and the largeness of their desire just as much as #X_1# longs for #X_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s and #X_4#'s father. The #X_0# appears only in the minds of #X_4# and #X_2#. #X_3# does not hear or see him, adding to the dream-like qualities of the play. His surreal contributions to the play add an outsider's commentary with the perspective of an insider. He is the father of #X_4# and #X_2# and yet he had so little to do with raising them he is a stranger. The #X_0# was with #X_2#'s mother for most of #X_2#'s childhood and simultaneously was having a secret relationship with #X_4#'s mother in another town. He lived a double life that became revealed when #X_2# and #X_4# were teenagers. The #X_0#'s presence in the play highlights the recurring themes of dual relationships, reality vs. illusion, lies vs. truth and the way stories and memories mutate and change as different people remember the same event. Through #X_5#'s inclusion of the #X_0#, we see the extent one person's selfish decisions can affect other people's lives for years to come and the way history may repeat itself or stop a pattern in abusive relationships and in families.

-- #X_0# --
A simple, innocent, and kind man who lives in a town near #X_2#'s hotel. #X_0# is a large man who works maintenance for places around town like the high school stadium. #X_0#'s innocence to sexual affairs and the kind of volatile passion that #X_2# and #X_1# exhibit before his entrance creates a dream-like quality to his appearance. It is as if #X_0# has stumbled into #X_2# and #X_1#'s surreal landscape and does not know why he is there or how he fits in. He is an audience to their conflicting stories and an involuntary sufferer to their verbal abuse and power struggle. #X_0# represents the hopeful, but dull life ahead of #X_2# if she chooses to let go of #X_1# for good. He is also an unknowing competitor to #X_1#. By nature #X_0# is uncompetitive, even offering to leave #X_1# and #X_2# alone, he makes #X_1#'s personality appear all the more absurd and ridiculous. The play ends with #X_0# looking out of the window at the fiery ball of #X_1#'s truck. He seems like a lost traveler swept up briefly in the storm of #X_1# and #X_2#'s life and dropped back to the ground suddenly and alone to sort out for himself the tumult that just brushed his own, simple life for a night.

-- #X_0# --
An American volunteer for the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War and the protagonist of For Whom the Bell Tolls. #X_0# is pragmatic, very good at what he does, and never lets his emotions interfere with his work. He appreciates physical pleasures like smelling pine trees, drinking absinthe, and having sex. At the same time, he is conflicted about his role within the war and within the larger world. Interior dialogues in which he argues with himself about these conflicts constitute a significant part of the novel. Over the course of the novel, he gradually resolves these tensions and learns to integrate his rational, thinking side with his intuitive, feeling side.

-- #X_0# --
The leader of the guerrilla camp. #X_0# is an individualist who feels responsible only to himself. #X_1# often compares him to a bull, a boar, and other burly, stubborn, and unpleasant animals. #X_0# used to be a great fighter and a great man but has now started drinking and has “gone bad,” as many characters remark. Tired of the war and attached to his horses, #X_0# is ready to betray the Republican cause at the start of the novel.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s part-gypsy “woman.” #X_0# means “pillar” in Spanish, and indeed, the fiercely patriotic, stocky, and steadfast #X_0# is—if not the absolute leader—the support center of the guerrilla group. #X_0# keeps the hearth, fights in battle, mothers #X_3#, and bullies #X_1# and #X_2#. She has an intuitive, mystical connection to deeper truths about the working of the world.

-- #X_0# --
A young woman with #X_2#’s band who falls in love with #X_3#. The victim of rape at the hands of Fascists who took over her town, #X_0# is frequently described by means of earth imagery. #X_1# compares her movements to a colt’s, and #X_3# affectionately calls her “Rabbit.”

-- #X_0# --
An old, trustworthy guerrilla fighter. For #X_1#, #X_0# represents all that is good about Spaniards. He lives close to the land, is loyal, follows directions, and stays where he is told. He likes to hunt but has not developed a taste for the kill and hates killing people. #X_0# has stopped praying ever since the Communists banned organized religion but admits that he misses it.

-- #X_0# --
A trustworthy and high-spirited guerrilla fighter. #X_0#, who mans the machine gun, curses frequently and is secretly in love with #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A guerrilla fighter in his mid-thirties. Short and with a lazy eye, #X_0# is dignified and literal-minded, embraces bureaucracy, and is easily offended by vulgarities. These factors, combined with his lack of a sense of humor, make #X_0# the frequent target of #X_2#’s jokes.

-- #X_0# --
An elderly guerrilla fighter. Despite his gray hair and broken nose, #X_0# has not learned the cynicism needed for survival in the war. His name, which means “primitive,” evokes his idealism as well as the basic, earthy lifestyle of all the guerrilleros.

-- #X_0# --
A gypsy member of the guerrilla band. Frequently described as well-meaning but “worthless,” #X_0# proves his worthlessness by leaving his lookout post at a crucial moment. He is a foil for the trustworthy #X_2#, who does not leave his post on the previous night despite the cold and the snow. #X_0# has few loyalties and does not believe in political causes.

-- #X_0# --
One of the guerrilla fighters, in his late twenties. #X_0# comes into conflict with the Republican leaders’ bureaucracy in his attempt to deliver #X_3# dispatch to the Republican command. #X_0# serves also a foil to #X_2#: although both #X_0# and #X_2# enjoy killing in an almost sexual way, #X_0# has had the opportunity to satisfy that thirst through his experience with bull-baiting during a town fiesta. As a result, unlike #X_2#, #X_0# has learned to identify and control his desire to kill.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s older brother and another of the guerrilla fighters. The jumpy #X_0# plays a relatively minor role in the novel. His most noticeable feature is that #X_2# repeatedly forgets his name. His death at the end of the novel attracts little notice.

-- #X_0# --
The leader of a guerrilla band that operates near #X_3#’s. Short, heavy, and gray-haired, #X_0# #X_0# (Spanish for “the deaf one”) is a man of few words. Like #X_4#, he is excited by a successful kill and is sad to die.

-- #X_0# --
One of the members of #Y_0# band. #X_0# originally wanted to be bullfighter but was too scared. He lost most of his family at the hands of the Fascists and cries when he talks about them. #X_0# buys into the Republicans’ propaganda but turns back to religion at the moment of his death, illustrating the emptiness of political rhetoric in times of true crisis.

-- #X_0# --
The Russian general, allied with the Republicans, who assigns #X_2# the bridge-blowing mission. #X_2# says that #X_0# is the best general he has served under, but the Republican military bureaucracy impedes all of #X_0#’s operations. #X_0# believes that thinking is useless because it breaks down resolve and impedes action.

-- #X_0# --
A Russian guerrilla operative who once worked with #X_1#’s band to blow up a train. Although #X_0# never appears in the novel, he is a foil for #X_2#. Unlike #X_2#, #X_0# was openly nervous.

-- #X_0# --
A well-connected foreign correspondent for the Russian newspaper #Y_1# and #X_1#’s friend in #Y_0#. #X_0#, the most intelligent man #X_1# knows, teaches #X_1# about the harsh realities of wartime politics. #X_0# believes that abstract philosophy is superior to action and intuition.

-- #X_0# --
A former barber and now commander of the battalion that #X_2# first reaches after crossing the Republican lines. #X_0# romanticizes the idea of guerrilla warfare and escorts #X_2# to several commanders, trying to reach General #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
A Republican staff office brigade commander. #X_0#’s only goal in the war is not to be demoted from his current rank. He is one of many examples of apathetic or inept Republican commanders who contribute to the eventual Republican defeat.

-- #X_0# --
The French Commissar of #Y_0#, the troops of foreign volunteers who serve on the Republican side in the war. #X_0# has become blinded by political paranoia and is convinced that he is surrounded by enemies.

-- #X_0# --
A devoutly Catholic Fascist officer who orders the beheading of #X_2# men. #X_0#’s sorrow for his dead friend, his awareness of the useless horror of war, and his tendency toward introspection make him a sympathetic character. #X_3#’s portrayal of #X_0# underscores the fact that the enemy side is not faceless but composed of real individuals who also make real and difficult decisions.

-- #X_0# --
An overconfident Fascist commander in charge of taking El Sordo’s hill. #X_0# serves as a foil for the more introspective Lieutenant #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s former lover, a bullfighter who died from complications from wounds received in a bullfight. Short, sad-eyed, and sullen, #X_0# was brave in the ring in spite of his fear of bulls. #X_0#, who appears in the novel only in #X_3#’s flashbacks, exemplifies the courage of #X_2#’s co#X_0# hero and #X_2#’s #X_0#ep respect for the bullfighting profession.

-- #X_0# --
A weak, religious man who could not stand up to his aggressive wife and eventually committed suicide. His #X_0#’s weakness is a constant source of embarrassment to #X_0# Jordan.

-- #X_0# --
A veteran of the American Civil War and a member of #Y_0#. #X_0# Jordan feels more closely related to his #X_0# than to his father.

-- #X_0# --

A high school senior and #X_2#’s boyfriend. #X_0# is passionate and cares deeply for #X_2# and his best friend #X_1#. He falls quickly for #X_2# and is ready to have sex with her, yet he is patient and respects her boundaries.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s best friend. #X_0# is adventurous, charming, and experimental. Like #X_2#, she’s a virgin at the beginning of the novel. She helps #X_1# explore his sexuality. As a result of her experiences, she decides that she wants to wait until she’s in love to have sex.

He brings the same fiery intensity to whatever job he does, whether it is manual labor or architecture. He loves the beautiful #X_1# with violent passion. He is the novel’s idealization of man, bringing innovative and joyful buildings to the rest of the world.

-- #X_0# --
The villain of the novel, and #X_2#’s antithesis—a man with a lust for power but no talent. Since his boyhood, #X_0# has despised the achievements of others, and he dedicates himself to squelching other people’s talents and ambitions. He is a small and fragile-looking man, but his persuasive voice and knack for manipulation make him a formidable opponent. He encourages selflessness and altruism to coax others into submission. His philosophy is a blend of religion, #Y_0# and #Y_1#, and he at times resembles the Russian dictator #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
Daughter of the prestigious architect Guy #X_0#, her fragile appearance, pale gold hair, and gray eyes belie her capability and bluntness. Dispassionate, cynical, and cold, #X_0# nurses a masochistic streak. Although she loves #X_4# and his beliefs, she initially tries to destroy him before the rest of the world can.

-- #X_0# --
The bastard son of #X_1# and a brother of the Night's Watch. Because he was a bastard, he was never treated as a true member of the #X_2# family, leaving him feeling uncertain of his identity. #X_0# joins the wildlings and pretends to be a turncoat, but the more time he spends in their company, the more he respects them, leading him to further questioning of his identity.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
Partial owner of the #X_0# Plantation. #X_0# organizes the events in the novel after she learns of the murder of #X_1# Bauton. She appears to be close friends with the blacks on the plantation, but actually possesses a form of benevolent racism consistent with her high social class. Although she appears headstrong and spunky when she confesses to #X_1#'s murder, she actually is blind in many ways. The man that she believes committed the crime, #X_3#, did not do it. With her unwillingness to let #X_3# handle the situation, #X_0# restricts his freedom and humanity. Still #X_0# is generally a good figure, who represents the possibility of a future for the plantation. By the end of the novel, she has grown more self-realized and lost some of her tacitly racist ways.

-- #X_0# --
The man suspected of killing #X_1# Baton because #X_1# was killed outside of #X_0#'s house and #X_0# is the toughest black man around. #X_0# is honored and respected by all of the characters in the novel, including #X_3# and the Sheriff #X_4#. #X_3# adores #X_0# because he basically raised her. Sheriff #X_4# and #X_0# have occasionally gone fishing. The other blacks have admired #X_0#'s willingness to stand up to local blacks and all want to help him. #X_0# is not a character without fault; he has excessive pride. He believes that he is superior to other blacks first because is not cowardly like them, and second because his dark skin shows that he has never been tainted with white blood. #X_0# changes throughout the novel as well. At its end, he realizes the faultiness of his excessive pride. Overall, #X_0# is a strong black man who is a role model for the other men.

-- #X_0# --
The Sheriff of #Y_0#. #X_0# is a complex character who is likeable in some ways, but whose techniques are outdated. #X_0# relies about the use of violence to interrogate the old black men, a technique that is unnecessary and harsh. #X_0# belongs to an older order of Southern men who did define their manhood by their ability to subjugate another. In this way, his time has past. Still, in some ways the Sheriff eludes the concept of race in his friendship with #X_1#. Sheriff #X_0# respects #X_1#'s manhood and therefore has gone fishing with him. The Sheriff's willingness to interact with a black man, shows is willing to live outside of the concept of race. Similarly, the Sheriff listens to the narratives of the older black men without complaint and shows no preference for whites in the final battle. In many ways, Sheriff #X_0# is a likable character, but his techniques suggest that he is stuck in an earlier Southern era.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s boyfriend. #X_0# is the most frequent narrator in the novel. He works as a journalist in #Y_0# and his style is detached and observant. In addition to being a narrator, #X_0# also is the representative of a new Southern male. #X_0# wants to marry #X_2#, who represents the plantation world, but he is an educated city journalist who does not entirely fit in at the plantation. Both Sheriff #X_3# and Miss #X_4# question #X_0#'s manhood when he fails to control and quiet #X_2# down. #X_0#'s relatively liberal view on her behavior differs from the older Southern masculinity that dominated women as well as land and blacks. #X_0#'s unique masculinity represents the changing times.

-- #X_0# --
The owner of a local plantation. #X_0# is generally a kindly lady whom #X_6# describes as being fat with a nice round face. #X_0# feels deeply concerned about #X_3#, whom she played a role in raising. She also mobilizes #X_3#'s effort to save #X_7#. #X_0# is a member of the ruling white class who distinguishes herself clearly from the blacks around her. Still, #X_0# differs greatly from #X_4# and #X_2# by being both aware and active in the community. Overall, #X_0# is a nice generous female character who seems slightly sad. She carries unrequited love for #X_4# Marshall and her attachment to #X_3# suggests that she may not have had children of her own.

-- #X_0# --
The Cajun farmer who leases #Y_0# and who is killed right before the action begins. Because he is dead for most of the novel, his role is largely symbolic. #X_0# represents all white men who perpetuated violence against blacks. #X_0#'s murder, similarly, represents the murder that many of the persecuted blacks may have fantasized about. #X_0#'s connection to the agricultural transformation of #Y_0# also makes him a symbol of the detrimental shift in local economic patterns.

-- #X_0# --
Father of Beau #X_0#. A man feared by local blacks for his violent behavior toward them. #X_0# is a classic Southern patriarch who rules his family and longs uses violence to maintain its honor. #X_0#'s presence dominates the novel since the characters all fear him. However, he is no longer the young man that he once was. Although #X_0# still contemplates exacting revenge, his ways are outdated. His time is past and he represents the old Southern order that is dying.

-- #X_0# --
One of the star football players on #Y_0#. #X_0# is also known by his nickname #X_5#. He is the brother of #X_1# and the son of #X_3#, but his ideas differ greatly from theirs. #X_0# represents a vision of a new social order that contains harmonious racial relations. #X_0#'s greatness as a football player is entirely dependent on his interaction with a black player named #X_2#, "#X_4#." #X_0# is to be a thoughtful, pained young man who feels stressed by the historical burden of racism that his father embodies. #X_0# also is brave however and his willingness to stand against the tradition of violence turns the historical tide.

-- #X_0# --
Works mostly closely with #X_1#, cutting and hauling cane everyday. #X_0# long has been known as a weak willed man who always runs from trouble and takes abuse from everyone with no shame. #X_0#'s character becomes completely redefined when it is discovered that he killed #X_1#. Furthermore, after #X_0# fled and returned, #X_0# seems imbued with a new courage that the other blacks admire. #X_0# symbolizes the strong realization of black masculinity.

-- #X_0# --
Part owner of the #X_0# plantation. #X_0# is drunk during the entire novel and says little. He represents the obsolescent order of plantation owners. He is ineffectual, usually intoxicated, and generally disinterested. His drinking might arise from his guilt over his family's slave owning past, but his inactivity suggests his lack of interest in making any effort to redefine his self. Furthermore, while his family's identity may disgust him, #X_0# clings to it with his snobbery. #X_0# is a useless ineffectual figure who appropriately owns deteriorating ineffectual plantation.

-- #X_0# --
Partial owner of the #X_0# Plantation. #X_0# is married to Jack #X_0#. #X_0#also is an old and ineffectual representative of the old plantation order. Like her husband, she spends most of her days drunk. She cares little for her niece and for the people who work in her plantation. In the opening scene, she searches in the weeds for pecans under a tree, which seems an accurate metaphor for how clueless she is to what is truly happening in the world. She too seems an appropriate useless mistress for a deteriorating Southern plantation.

-- #X_0# --
The servant of #Y_0#. She fits into the classic role of a "house Negro," a role that has existed and been pointed out since the times of slavery. #X_0# maintains allegiance to more subservient ideas of race. For example, she tells #X_1# to refer to the whites with "Miss" or "Mr" and refuses to let him in the front yard. Like the other residents of #Y_0#, #X_0# exists in the past social structure of plantation times. She clings to their ideas of the world, which are outdated.

-- #X_0# --
Leads a group of men against the blacks at #Y_0#. #X_0# has rough manners and a rough temperament. #X_0# possesses outdated ideas, crass manners, and dirty hands. In addition to being a ruffian, #X_0# is in many ways a coward. Before going to the lynching, for example, #X_0# and his men get drunk so that they can have the willpower to undertake the violence ahead of them. Their need to exist as a drunk mob shows them as insecure men who pray on others in order to achieve a sense of superiority. #X_0#, however, is just a troublemaker not worthy of admiration.

-- #X_0# --
One of the narrators and the owner of a local bar/corner store. #X_0# #X_0#'s primary concern is pleasing his customers. #X_0#may not be a deep racist at heart, but his unwillingness to counter the racist ideas voiced in his bar make him a tacit accomplice in the crimes that they commit. #X_0#represents the quiet acceptance of racist values in the South and the difficulty of complete social change.

He was born in #Y_2# to Korean parents of few means and raised by a middle-class #Y_2#ese couple. Known at the time as #X_4#, he joined #Y_3# and served as a medic in #Y_1# during the final days of World War II. Now in his seventies, Doc #X_0# has recently retired and struggles with dark memories from his past.

-- #X_0# --
Doc #X_0#’s adopted daughter. #X_0# was orphaned as a young child and raised in a ramshackle orphanage in #Y_0#. She came to #Y_1# at the age of seven and lived with Doc #X_0# until the age of seventeen, when she left home and became estranged from her adopted father. #X_0# has an obstinate and sometimes rebellious personality that strained her relationship with Doc #X_0# from the beginning.

Comfort woman at #Y_0#. #X_0#kutaeh, or “#X_0#” as #X_1# called her, was born to a notable and well-established #X_0#orean family. Though her father was a respected scholar and ambassador, the family fell on hard times. When the war flared up and young men were forced to enlist, #X_0#’s parents arranged to spare their only son from the fight by volunteering #X_0# and her sister instead.

She ran away once, to #X_2#, to whom she was attracted, but he made her return to her husband. She endured her husband's debauchery but sent away their son, #X_1#, at the age of seven, with the hope that he would never discover his dead father's immorality. (His father died ten years before the start of the play.) #X_0# #X_0# has established an orphan asylum (an orphanage) to memorialize his death, and it is schedule to be dedicated the following day.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is a local priest from the nearby town. He often lectures others about morality and religion. Sometimes, his financial dealings regarding the orphanage seem suspect, and he is also quick to bend to public opinion. He believes that Mrs. #X_2# should not have abandoned her husband and should not have sent her son into the world at such an early age. He is easily shocked.

-- #X_0# --
At the play's start, #X_0# has come home to spend the winter with his mother. He has most recently been in #Y_0#, living a relatively bohemian life. He is also a promising painter. Pastor #X_1# believes that he has strayed from what is moral and also finds him reminiscent of his father. #X_0# is by nature idealistic. Recently, however, he has felt a profound listlessness, for which he blames himself. He also shows a romantic interest in #X_2#.

Throughout the play, she resists her father's dubious affection and takes pride from working in Mrs. #X_1#'s home. She seems to return #X_4#'s affection, even peppering her speech with French, which she has learned in the hope that #X_4# will take her to #Y_0#. However, she is careful not to overstep the bounds of what is proper.

When speaking to Pastor #X_3#, whom the hypocritical #X_0# always tries to please, he describes the establishment as a place to reform sailors. But when he describes it to #X_4#, it sounds like a high-class saloon. He is an alcoholic.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#died ten years prior to the start of the play. He was a very famous man with a good reputation, and before he died he was made a chamberlain. He never appears in the play but is often referred to. According to Mrs. #X_0#'s account, he was, in fact, a lazy, dissolute man.

To protect his friends and neighbors, he removes the stakes he finds in their land that belong to earlier settlers.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s suffering wife. Unlike her husband, #X_0# cannot endure life on the prairie, and she longs to return to the comforts of her home in #Y_0#.

Incapable of severing ties to her old country, she gradually sinks into depression and thinks about death. When a plague of locusts arrive, #X_0# descends into madness, and #X_2# fears for her and the children's safety.

At the same time, however, the mere fact that she takes the time to impart her knowledge suggests a deeper caring for the girl.

#X_0# preadolescent daughter who listens to her mother’s speech. #X_0# daughter says little, speaking only to defend herself against her mother’s accusations that she will one day become a “slut.” #X_0# girl’s protestations suggest resentment, but #X_1# does not provide her true thoughts or feelings.

After his training begins, #X_0#’s universe widens dramatically.

#X_0# old man known in the community as the Receiver of Memory. #X_0# has held the community’s collective memory for many years and uses his wisdom to help #Y_0# make important decisions, even though he is racked by the pain his memories give him and believes that perhaps those memories belong in the minds of everyone in the community.

#X_1#’s charismatic but reckless father. #X_0# loves to speak of his own accomplishments, portraying himself as special and above the rules.

We later learn he had a difficult childhood and is a survivor of sexual abuse.

#X_1#’s mother, a passionate artist and self-proclaimed “excitement addict.” She is ambivalent about domestic responsibilities, such as cooking, cleaning, and disciplining children.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father who worked on the railroad when #X_2# was a child. Unlike his wife, #X_3#, and his son, #X_5#, #X_0# doesn’t make much of an impression on #X_4#, neither abetting his wife’s abuse nor challenging it.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s daughter and #X_2#’s older sister. #X_0# has a bad leg, on which she has to wear a brace, and walks with a limp. Twenty-three years old and painfully shy, she has largely withdrawn from the outside world and devotes herself to old records and her collection of glass figurines.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
An old acquaintance of #X_2# and #X_1#. #X_0# was a popular athlete in high school and is now a shipping clerk at the shoe warehouse in which #X_2# works. He is unwaveringly devoted to goals of professional achievement and ideals of personal success.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s husband and #X_2# and #X_3#’s father. #X_0# was a handsome man who worked for a telephone company. He abandoned his family years before the action of the play and never appears onstage. His picture, however, is prominently displayed in the #X_0#s’ living room.

-- #X_0# --
A washed-up real estate salesman in his fifties. #X_0# "The Machine" #X_0# was successful years ago, but recently has hit a streak of "bad luck" and finds himself in danger of getting fired. He desperately wants to save his career, and this desperation is usually grotesquely apparent.

-- #X_0# --
A big-shot real estate salesman in his early forties. #X_0# is the top name on the board at his office, which means he is currently the most successful salesman. It is easy to see why he does better than the other men: he is smart, charming, and incredibly quick-witted. Rather than trying to force customers to submit to his sales tactics, as the others do, he lures people into thinking they want what he is selling.

-- #X_0# --
The manager of the real estate office, who is in his early forties. #X_0#'s job is to oversee the operations of the office and to assign the salesmen their leads. The salesmen dislike him because of his status as "company man"—he merely follows orders from #X_2# and #X_3#, and the salesmen do not think he really understands the business.

-- #X_0# --
An angry real estate salesman in his fifties. #X_0# harbors a great deal of resentment toward the company. He is not a subtle man, and tends to lash out angrily when under pressure. His sheer aggression makes him a more successful salesman than #X_1# or #X_2#, but he has none of #Y_0#'s verbal agility.

-- #X_0# --
A timid real estate salesman in his fifties. #X_0# is extremely meek and mild- mannered. In conversation, faster talkers like #X_2# and #X_3# easily overpower him. His dullness is evident in his conversational tendency to merely repeat what other people are saying to him. Like #X_1#, #X_0# is not on the board and is in immediate danger of getting fired.

-- #X_0# --
A quiet, timid man in his early forties. We know that #X_0# fears his wife, but we do not know what he does for a living or virtually anything else about his personal life. #X_0# tells #Y_0# that within his marriage he does not have the power to negotiate business deals.

-- #X_0# --
A police detective in his early forties. We learn extremely little about #X_0#'s personality, as he spends most of Act Two offstage in #X_1#'s inner office, interrogating the salesmen about their knowledge of the break-in. #X_0#'s presence increases the tension in Act Two: we are aware that #X_0# is investigating in the next room while all the onstage action is happening, and we therefore know that #X_0# will be right there to make an arrest when the thief's identity is revealed.

-- #X_0# --
The two bosses of the real estate company who never themselves appear as characters in the play. #X_0#give #X_3# orders about how to run the office. They institute the nerve-wracking "sales contest" wherein the best salesman that month will win a #Y_0# and the worst two will be fired. #X_2# and #X_1# both believe that #X_0#ultimately bear responsibility for the cruel and unforgiving nature of their work environment.

-- #X_0# --
A former salesman who has gone into business for himself and never himself appears as a character in the play. In his new business, #X_0# now competes with #X_1# and #X_3#. #X_2# suggests that #X_0#'s business practices are wiser and more humane than #X_1# and #X_3#'s, but we have no way of knowing if this is true. At any rate, #X_0#'s willingness to buy stolen leads demonstrates that he is no more ethical than #X_1# and #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
A couple who purchase real estate but never appear in the play as characters themselves. The #X_0#s are notorious in the sales community for wasting salesmen's time. They enjoy talking to salesmen but can never afford what they end up buying. They are classic "deadbeats."

-- #X_0# --
A mysterious character we never see. When #X_3# threatens to get #X_4# fired, he tells him of his plan to go to #X_1# and #X_2#'s office to talk to "#X_0#." This is all we know about #X_0#, but we can infer that he is someone of importance who has the power to terminate employees in #X_1# and #X_2#'s office. In fact, "#X_0#" may be #X_1# or #X_2#'s surname.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the anonymous protagonist (her name is an allusion to a Jefferson Airplane song) whose intermittent diary entries narrate Go Ask #X_0#.

Although #X_0# #X_0# no longer lives in #Y_0#, she is still deeply connected to the town emotionally, and during her visit, she has many nostalgic flashbacks to her youth. #X_0# #X_0# has a very strong moral streak. Throughout her life, she has worshipped and idolized her father, #X_2#, as the paragon of ethics. As a child, #X_0# #X_0# had been a tomboy, and she had an awkward transition into adolescence and womanhood. As an adult, she feels out of place among the ladies of #Y_0#. #X_0# #X_0# and #X_3# Clinton, her brother’s childhood best friend, have become a couple, and every time #X_0# #X_0# returns to town, #X_3# wants to marry her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s father and a prominent lawyer in #Y_0#. #X_0# is a widower who is universally respected for his integrity and sense of justice. He has developed arthritis, which hinders him physically, though his mind is still sharp. After Jem died, #X_0# hired #X_2# to be his junior partner at the law firm. #X_3# always held up #X_0# as the pinnacle of virtue. When #X_3# sees #X_0# at a meeting of the #Y_0# County Citizen’s Council, a racist organization, her entire world is thrown off-kilter, since if #X_0# isn’t a moral compass, she doesn’t know what she can trust. But #X_0# always abides by his principle that the law comes first and foremost.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s aunt and #X_2#’s sister. A commanding, domineering presence, #X_0# has a generous heart and kind spirit underneath her imperious, bossy exterior. She is always dressed in a full corset, as though constantly in a suit of armor. #X_0# and #X_3# bicker all the time, and they know exactly how to get on each other’s nerves. #X_0# wants #X_3# to behave more like a genteel Southern lady, which makes #X_3# act even more rebelliously than she might have originally been inclined to be. Although #X_0# comes across as brittle and brash, she has the family’s best interest at heart.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s uncle and #X_2#’s brother. #X_0# is a retired medical doctor who lives alone in town and spends his days immersed in literature rather than getting involved in town actions and town politics. #X_0# is extremely bright and quick, and #X_3# enjoys verbally sparring with him. #X_0# serves as a secondary father figure to #X_3#, and she turns to him when she feels that #X_2# is a hypocrite. Even though #X_0# tends to avoid conflict and retreat into his own home, he eventually slaps #X_3# to reprimand her for her anger and to try and make her understand #X_2#’s behavior.

-- #X_0# --
#X_7#’s older brother. #X_0# died of a heart condition in his early twenties. #X_0#’s death deeply shook the #X_0# family. #X_7# looked up to #X_0#, and throughout her childhood, #X_0# was her protector and role model. Since he died so young, her image of him and his role in her life has never been tarnished. Even though he never appears in Go Set a Watchman, #X_7# has frequent flashbacks to her childhood in which #X_0# always plays a central part. #X_6#, #X_0#’s childhood best friend, has taken over the role of a son to #X_3#, though #X_6#’s feelings towards #X_7# are far more than brotherly. #X_4# deeply loved #X_0# as well, and although she no longer works for the #X_0#es, she still misses him. After #X_0#’s death, #X_2# tried to convince #X_7# that #X_3# needed her to move back to #X_9#, but #X_7# knows that #X_3# wants her to make her own independent choices, though this decision does make #X_7# feel guilty sometimes.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#’s suitor and #X_2#’s law partner. #X_0# was #X_6#’s best friend when they were growing up, and now, he has been courting #X_4# for several years. #X_0# had always been close with the #X_3#, and when #X_6# died, he became like another son to #X_2#. #X_0# wants to marry #X_4#, which he tells her repeatedly throughout her visit to #X_7#, but even though she flirts with him, she always has an excuse or rebuff. #X_0# desperately wants to achieve the same sort of social status that the #X_3# have in town. He doesn’t come from quite as esteemed a family, so he must continually prove his own worth. #X_1# doesn’t think that #X_0# is of the same social order as the #X_3#, so she discourages #X_4# from marrying him. While #X_1#’s reaction does spur #X_4# to flirt more with #X_0#, deep down, #X_4# has the same feeling about their relationship. Although they may like each other and get along, at the end of the day, it will never quite work.

-- #X_0# --
The black cook who worked for the #X_1# when #X_2# and #X_4# were growing up. #X_0# was a mother figure for #X_2# and #X_4#. Atticus was the one who raise them morally and instilled ethical values in his children, but #X_0# provided the day-to-day lessons and discipline. When #X_2# transitioned from childhood to womanhood, #X_0# helped explain the ways of the world to her. #X_0# played an essential role in #X_2#’s childhood, but now, #X_0# doesn’t work for the #X_1# anymore, and she has distanced herself from their family.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s and #X_4#’s childhood friend. #X_0# plays with #X_2# and #X_4# in the summertime, when #X_1# is not in town, so #X_1# and #X_0# never interact. #X_0# only appears in flashbacks in Go Set a Watchman, since he moved to Europe after World War II and never returned to #X_5#. #X_2# was very fond of #X_0# when she was a child, though these feelings never turned into romantic sensations, since #X_2# and #X_0# mostly played with each other when #X_2# was still a child and very tomboyish. #X_2#’s memories involving #X_0# make her remember #X_5# very fondly and nostalgically.

-- #X_0# --
The music director at the Methodist church, which the #X_1# attend. #X_0# tries to change the rhythm of the Doxology, a hymn that the congregation has sung in exactly the same way for generations.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s protagonist. #X_0# is a pretty, coquettish Southern belle who grows up on the #Y_0# plantation of #Y_1# in the years before the Civil War. Selfish, shrewd, and vain, #X_0# inherits the strong will of her father, #X_3#, but also desires to please her well-bred, genteel mother, #X_2#. When hardships plague #X_0#, she shoulders the troubles of her family and friends. #X_0#’s simultaneous desire for the Southern gentleman #X_1# and the opportunistic New Southerner #X_4# parallels the South’s struggle to cling to tradition and still survive in the new era.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s third husband, and a dashing, dangerous adventurer and scoundrel. Expelled from West Point and disowned by his prominent #X_1# family, #X_0# becomes an opportunistic blockade-runner during the war, emerging as one of the only rich Southern men in #Y_0# after the war. #X_0# proves himself a loving father and, at times, a caring husband. Though he loves #X_2#, his pride prevents him from showing her his love, and it even leads him to brutality. Candid, humorous, and contemptuous of silly social codes, #X_0# exposes hypocrisy wherever he goes. He represents postwar society, a pragmatic, fast-paced world in which the strong thrive and the weak perish.

-- #X_0# --
The handsome, chivalrous, and honorable heir to the Twelve Oaks plantation near #Y_0#. #X_0# bewitches #X_1# through most of the novel.

After the two women suffer together through the Civil War, however, a strong bond forms between them. Eventually, #X_3# understands that #X_0#’s unflagging love and support has been a source of strength for her. Like #X_1#, #X_0# embodies the values of the Old South, but in contrast to #X_1#’s futile dreaming, #X_0# faces the world with quiet but powerful inner strength.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s father. #X_0# is a passionately loyal Confederate who immigrated to #Y_0# from #Y_1# as a young man. His strong will, tendency to drink, and selfishness echo in #X_1#’s nature. #X_1# also inherits #X_0#’s love for the South and for his plantation, #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#’s mother, and a descendent of the aristocratic #X_3# family. #X_0# marries #X_1# and devotes herself to running #X_5# after her father forbids her love affair with #X_2#, her cousin. Refined and compassionate, strong and firm, #X_0# serves as an impossible ideal for the willful #X_4#. Even after #X_0#’s death, #X_4# struggles with the competing desires to please her mother and please herself.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s childhood nurse. #X_2# is an old, heavyset slave who was also nurse to #X_3#’s mother, #X_1#. Loyal and well-versed in Southern etiquette, #X_2# keeps #X_3# in line. After #X_1#’s death, #X_2# becomes for #X_3# one of the only living reminders of the Old South.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s brother and #X_2#’s first husband. #X_0# is a timid and bland boy for whom #X_2# feels no love. #X_0#’s death early in the war confines #X_2# to the role of widow. #X_2# finds the social expectations surrounding widowhood—that she wear a black veil, for example, and refrain from laughter and pleasure—overly restrictive.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# and Charles #X_0#’s aunt. #X_0# #X_0# is a flighty old maid who faints from shock several times a day. #X_4# lives with #X_0# #X_0# for much of her stay in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#’s third and last child. #X_0# is the daughter of #X_2# #X_0#. Spoiled and strong-willed like her mother, #X_0# elicits utter devotion from #X_2# and eventually replaces #X_4# as the center of #X_2#’s attention.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The novel's narrator, #X_0# is the reader's only guide through the twisted story of the thirteen years the couple spent in #Y_0#. He is a naïve man, quickly taken in by appearances, and easily cuckolded by his wife* He tells the disjointed story of his own gradual understanding of what has occurred. Ultimately, he is a man who has lost all moral certitude, all comprehension of right and wrong. He is described by several literary critics as the quintessential "modern man."

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#'s wife, and the adulteress of the novel, #X_0# is a manipulative and deceptive woman. Because she never really communicates with her husband, #X_0#'s story is the only one that is never told. #X_0# desires to be the lady of her ancestors' home, #Y_0# in #Y_1#, and she is willing to have an affair with #X_1# in order to achieve that position. Feigning a heart condition, #X_0# deceives her husband in order to control him and gain greater freedom for herself.

-- #X_0# --
Described as a "sheer individualist," #X_0# cares deeply that her affairs are in order and that the #X_0# family maintains every ounce of propriety. She is economical, practical, and efficient with matters of money. Though she has the capacity to be deeply in love with her husband, #X_2#, she is also easily hurt by him. When wounded, #X_0# defends herself with great power and cruelty. Above all, she seeks to have a "normal" life, free of the distractions of her husband's passion.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# describes #X_0# #X_0# as "the cleanest looking sort of chap," "an excellent magistrate, a first-rate soldier, and one of the best landlords." He appears to be exactly the sort of man one could trust with his wife. He is generous with those who live on his land and even jumps overboard from a ship to save a drowning man. But #X_0# is not practical; he is a poor manager of money and easily led by instincts of lust and passion. Though the narrator deeply sympathizes with #X_0#'s "good intentions," such an assessment of him is questionable.

-- #X_0# --
Also known as "the Girl," #X_0#becomes the ward of #X_2# and #X_1# after her mother abandons her and her father leaves for #Y_0#. Having been educated in a convent school with nuns, #X_0# remains very naive and unworldly. She is in awe of what she perceives to be her heroic uncle (#X_1#) and his wonderful marriage. She willingly "sacrifices" herself to save #X_1# at the end of the story, but ultimately, along with the other "passionate" people, she is destroyed by madness.

-- #X_0# --
A cabin boy who travels with the #X_4#on their trip around the world, #X_0# becomes #X_3#'s first lover. #X_0# is of a much lower class than either the #X_4# or the #X_1#sand he continues his affair with #X_3# by lying to #X_1# about #X_3#'s heart condition. It is an embarrassment that #X_3# could have an affair with someone so low and ill-mannered.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is described by #X_1# as young, gentle, and "so submissive." Only twenty-three years old, Mrs. #X_0# is recently married to a young man about the same age, although his job in the army keeps them separated. Though #X_0# is indeed vulnerable to those who seek to trick her, it is questionable whether she is truly submissive, as #X_1# assumes. From the same convent school as #Y_0#, Mrs. #X_0# preserves some of the strict morality that was once taught to her.

-- #X_0# --
Described by #X_1# as "quite an economical person of so normal a figure that he can get quite a large portion of his clothes ready-made," #X_0# is portrayed as the utterly normal (and somewhat boring) British man. He is the second husband of #X_3#, and is mentioned, but does not act, in the story. His character serves as a foil to #X_2#; #X_0# is 'perfectly normal' and quite respectable in his quiet (passionless) liaisons.

Because she is closer to #X_1#'s class, the affair they begin seems relatively safe and ends when #X_1# leaves #Y_0#. But when he learns of the affair, Major #X_0# endeavors to blackmail #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --

In a dream, God promised him that his descendents would bear His seal. He married #X_1#, had an adulterous affair with #X_3#, and endured the early death of his unacknowledged son, #X_5#al, from a distance.

#X_1#’s immensely wealthy husband, once a member of #X_4#’s social club at #Y_0#. Powerfully built and hailing from a socially solid old family, #X_0# is an arrogant, hypocritical bully. His social attitudes are laced with racism and sexism, and he never even considers trying to live up to the moral standard he demands from those around him. He has no moral qualms about his own extramarital affair with #X_3#, but when he begins to suspect #X_1# and #X_2# of having an affair, he becomes outraged and forces a confrontation.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s friend, a woman with whom #X_2# becomes romantically involved during the course of the novel. A competitive golfer, #X_0# represents one of the “new women” of the 1920s—cynical, boyish, and self-centered. #X_0# is beautiful, but also dishonest: she cheated in order to win her first golf tournament and continually bends the truth.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s lover, whose lifeless husband #X_2# owns a run-down garage in the valley of ashes. #X_0# herself possesses a fierce vitality and desperately looks for a way to improve her situation. Unfortunately for her, she chooses #X_3#, who treats her as a mere object of his desire.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s husband, the lifeless, exhausted owner of a run-down auto shop at the edge of the valley of ashes. #X_0# loves and idealizes #X_2#, and is devastated by her affair with #X_3#. #X_0# is consumed with grief when #X_2# is killed. #X_0# is comparable to #X_1# in that both are dreamers and both are ruined by their unrequited love for women who love #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The eccentric, bespectacled drunk whom #X_3# meets at the first party he attends at #X_2#’s mansion. #X_3# finds #X_0# looking through #X_2#’s library, astonished that the books are real.

-- #X_0# --
The shallow freeloader who seems almost to live at #X_1#’s mansion, taking advantage of his host’s money. As soon as #X_1# dies, #X_0# disappears—he does not attend the funeral, but he does call #X_2# about a pair of tennis shoes that he left at #X_1#’s mansion.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s friend, a prominent figure in organized crime. Before the events of the novel take place, #X_0# helped #X_2# to make his fortune bootlegging illegal liquor. His continued acquaintance with #X_2# suggests that #X_2# is still involved in illegal business.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist and narrator of the novel. A great, bearlike monster, #X_0# is the first of three monsters defeated by the Geatish hero #X_1# in the sixth-century poem #X_1#. In #X_0#, he is a lonely creature who seeks an understanding of the seemingly meaningless world around him. As an outsider, #X_0# observes and provides commentary on the human civilization he battles.

-- #X_0# --
King of the Danes. #X_0# maintains a highly powerful and prosperous kingdom until #X_1# begins terrorizing the area. In Beowulf, #X_0# is an exemplary model of kingship, but in #X_1# he is more flawed and human. #X_1# often describes his war with the humans as a personal battle between #X_0# and himself.

-- #X_0# --
A harpist and storyteller in Hrothgar’s court. #X_0#provides the Danes with an image of the world as essentially connected and purposeful—an image that #X_2# finds incredibly seductive, despite his awareness that the glorious stories of Hrothgar’s court are built on a foundation of lies. #X_0#represents the power of art and imagination to create meaning in a meaningless world.

-- #X_0# --
A great cranky beast that rules over a vast hoard of treasure. #X_0#provides a vision of the world as essentially meaningless and empty. Throughout the novel, #X_1# frequently finds himself weighing the fatalistic words of the #X_0# against the beautiful words of the #X_2#. Some critics hold that the #X_0# is not actually a separate character, but rather a personified aspect of #X_1#’s own mind. Although #X_1# only visits the #X_0# once, he feels its presence throughout the novel.

-- #X_0# --
A Geatish hero who comes across the sea to rid the Scyldings of Grendel. Huge and exceedingly strong, #X_0#is cold and mechanical, showing little emotion or personality. In the climactic battle with Grendel, #X_0#appears to sprout wings and speak fire, prompting comparisons to the dragon.

-- #X_0# --
A foul, wretched being, and #X_0# only apparent family member. #X_0# lives with #X_1# in a cave in a vast underground realm. She desperately tries to protect #X_1# from the humans and his fate. She has either forgotten or never knew how to speak, though at times her gibberish approaches coherent language.

-- #X_0# --
A Scylding hero who is unable to defeat #X_1# in battle. #X_0# believes wholeheartedly in the heroic ideals of his warrior culture. When #X_1# denies #X_0# the opportunity to embody those ideals, he becomes a bitter and broken man.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s wife and queen of the Danes. Originally a Helming princess, #X_0#represents love, altruism, and an ideal image of womanhood, bringing balance and harmony to her adopted community.

-- #X_0# --
Hrothgar’s orphaned nephew. In Beowulf, #X_0# usurps Hrothgar’s son as ruler of the Scyldings. In Grendel, #X_0# is a young man who forms ideas of revolution after seeing the aristocratic thanes subjugate the Danish peasants.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mentor and advisor. A crotchety old man, #X_0# believes that all governments are inherently evil and that revolution does nothing but replace one corrupt system with another.

-- #X_0# --
An old, blind, Scylding priest. #X_0# is a theologian—one who studies the theories behind religion. Mistaking #X_1# for the Destroyer, the supreme Scylding deity, #X_0# describes ultimate wisdom as a vision of a universe in which nothing is lost or wasted. #X_0# is one of only a few priests in the novel for whom religion is more than an empty show.

-- #X_0# --
A younger #X_0# who is overjoyed at the news of #X_2#’s encounter with the Destroyer. #X_0#has a vision of the universe to which #X_1# alludes in his battle with Grendel.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# first creature #X_1# encounters in the novel. #X_0# stands stupidly at the edge of a cliff and will not budge despite #X_1#’s repeated protests.

-- #X_0# --
A #X_0# that discovers #X_1# hanging in a tree  and attacks him repeatedly. #X_0# encounter with  the #X_0# is a formative event in #X_1#’s  philosophical development.

-- #X_0# --
A #X_0# that climbs a cliff despite #X_1#’s repeated yells and screams. #X_1# tries to bludgeon the #X_0# to death with stones, but it continues to climb.

-- #X_0# --
The legendary king from whom Hrothgar is descended. In #X_0# #X_0#’s honor, the Danes are sometimes referred to as the #X_0#ings.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s teenage daughter. #X_2# plans to marry #X_0# off to #X_3# in order to avoid a war with the #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A young man when he first arrives at #Y_0# with the #X_1#, the young apprentice takes over the #X_0# duties upon his death.

-- #X_0# --
Hrothgar’s brother and Hrothulf’s father. When  #X_0# is murdered, Hrothulf comes to live with his uncle at Hart.

-- #X_0# --
King of the #X_2# and Wealtheow’s brother. #X_0#, a young king who is gaining in power and prominence, presents #X_3# with a constant military threat.

-- #X_0# --
King of the Heathobards and an enemy of  the Scyldings.

-- #X_0# --
King of the Geats and Beowulf’s lord.

-- #X_0# --
Beowulf’s father.

-- #X_0# --
Characters in a song that the Shaper’s assistant sings at the Shaper’s funeral.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator and protagonist of the story. Although Lemuel #X_0#’s vivid and detailed style of narration makes it clear that he is intelligent and well educated, his perceptions are naïve and gullible. He has virtually no emotional life, or at least no awareness of it, and his comments are strictly factual. Indeed, sometimes his obsession with the facts of navigation, for example, becomes unbearable for us, as his fictional editor, #X_2#, makes clear when he explains having had to cut out nearly half of #X_0#’s verbiage. #X_0# never thinks that the absurdities he encounters are funny and never makes the satiric connections between the lands he visits and his own home. #X_0#’s naïveté makes the satire possible, as we pick up on things that #X_0# does not notice.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# ruler of #Y_0#. Like all #Y_0#ians, the #X_0# is fewer than six inches tall. His power and majesty impress #X_1# deeply, but to us he appears both laughable and sinister. Because of his tiny size, his belief that he can control #X_1# seems silly, but his willingness to execute his subjects for minor reasons of politics or honor gives him a frightening aspect. He is proud of possessing the tallest trees and biggest palace in the kingdom, but he is also quite hospitable, spending a fortune on his captive’s food. #X_0# is both a satire of the autocratic ruler and a strangely serious portrait of political power.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s first master in Brobdingnag. #X_0# speaks to #X_1#, showing that he is willing to believe that the relatively tiny #X_1# may be as rational as he himself is, and treats him with gentleness. However, the #X_0# puts #X_1# on display around Brobdingnag, which clearly shows that he would rather profit from his discovery than converse with him as an equal. His exploitation of #X_1# as a laborer, which nearly starves #X_1# to death, seems less cruel than simpleminded. Generally, the #X_0# represents the average Brobdingnagian of no great gifts or intelligence, wielding an extraordinary power over #X_1# simply by virtue of his immense size.

-- #X_0# --
The farmer’s nine-year-old daughter, who is forty feet tall. #X_0# becomes #X_1#’s friend and nursemaid, hanging him to sleep safely in her closet at night and teaching him the #Y_0#ian language by day. She is skilled at sewing and makes #X_1# several sets of new clothes, taking delight in dressing him. When the queen discovers that no one at court is suited to care for #X_1#, she invites #X_0# to live at court as his sole babysitter, a function she performs with great seriousness and attentiveness. To #X_0#, #X_1# is basically a living doll, symbolizing the general status #X_1# has in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# of #Y_0#, who is so delighted by #X_1#’s beauty and charms that she agrees to buy him from the farmer for 1,000 pieces of gold. #X_1# appreciates her kindness after the hardships he suffers at the farmer’s and shows his usual fawning love for royalty by kissing the tip of her little finger when presented before her. She possesses, in #X_1#’s words, “infinite” wit and humor, though this description may entail a bit of #X_1#’s characteristic flattery of superiors. #X_0# seems genuinely considerate, asking #X_1# whether he would consent to live at court instead of simply taking him in as a pet and inquiring into the reasons for his cold good-byes with the farmer. She is by no means a hero, but simply a pleasant, powerful person.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# of #Y_0#, who, in contrast to the emperor of Lilliput, seems to be a true intellectual, well versed in political science among other disciplines. While his wife has an intimate, friendly relationship with the diminutive visitor, the #X_0#’s relation to #X_1# is limited to serious discussions about the history and institutions of #X_1#’s native land. He is thus a figure of rational thought who somewhat prefigures the #X_2# in Book IV.

-- #X_0# --
A lord of #Y_0#, capital of the underdeveloped land beneath #Y_1#, who hosts #X_2# and gives him a tour of the country on #X_2#’s third voyage. #X_0# is a rare example of practical-minded intelligence both in #Y_0#, where the applied sciences are wildly impractical, and in #Y_1#, where no one even considers practicality a virtue. He fell from grace with the ruling elite by counseling a commonsense approach to agriculture and land management in #Y_0#, an approach that was rejected even though it proved successful when applied to his own flourishing estate. #X_0# serves as a reality check for #X_2# on his third voyage, an objective-minded contrast to the theoretical delusions of the other inhabitants of #Y_1# and #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
Unkempt humanlike beasts who live in servitude to the #X_2#. #X_0# seem to belong to various ethnic groups, since there are blond #X_0# as well as dark-haired and redheaded ones. The men are characterized by their hairy bodies, and the women by their low-hanging breasts. They are naked, filthy, and extremely primitive in their eating habits. #X_0# are not capable of government, and thus they are kept as servants to the #X_2#, pulling their carriages and performing manual tasks. They repel #X_1# with their lascivious sexual appetites, especially when an eleven-year-old #Y_0# girl attempts to rape #X_1# as he is bathing naked. Yet despite #X_1#’s revulsion for these disgusting creatures, he ends his writings referring to himself as a #Y_0#, just as the #X_2# do as they regretfully evict him from their realm. Thus, “#Y_0#” becomes another term for human, at least in the semideranged and self-loathing mind of #X_1# at the end of his fourth journey.

-- #X_0# --
Rational horses who maintain a simple, peaceful society governed by reason and truthfulness—they do not even have a word for “lie” in their language. #X_0# are like ordinary horses, except that they are highly intelligent and deeply wise. They live in a sort of socialist republic, with the needs of the community put before individual desires. They are the masters of the Yahoos, the savage humanlike creatures in #X_2#. In all, the #X_0# have the greatest impact on #X_1# throughout all his four voyages. He is grieved to leave them, not relieved as he is in leaving the other three lands, and back in #Y_0# he relates better with his horses than with his human family. The #X_0# thus are a measure of the extent to which #X_1# has become a misanthrope,  or “human-hater”; he is certainly, at the end, a  horse lover.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# who first discovers #X_1# and takes him into his own home. Wary of #X_0# Yahoolike appearance at first, the #X_0# is hesitant to make contact with him, but #X_0# ability to mimic the #X_0#’s own words persuades the #X_0# to protect #X_1#. The #X_0#’s domestic cleanliness, propriety, and tranquil reasonableness of speech have an extraordinary impact on #X_1#. It is through this horse that #X_1# is led to reevaluate the differences between humans and beasts and to question humanity’s claims to rationality.

-- #X_0# --
The Portuguese captain who takes #X_1# back to Europe after he is forced to leave the land of the #X_2#. #X_0# #X_0# is naturally benevolent and generous, offering the half-crazed #X_1# his own best suit of clothes to replace the tatters he is wearing. But #X_1# meets his generosity with repulsion, as he cannot bear the company of Yahoos. By the end of the voyage, #X_0# #X_0# has won over #X_1# to the extent that he is able to have a conversation with him, but the captain’s overall Yahoolike nature in #X_1#’s eyes alienates him from #X_1# to the very end.

-- #X_0# --
Giants whom #X_2# meets on his second voyage. #X_0# are basically a reasonable and kindly people governed by a sense of justice. Even the farmer who abuses #X_2# at the beginning is gentle with him, and politely takes the trouble to say good-bye to him upon leaving him. The farmer’s daughter, #X_1#, gives #X_2# perhaps the most kindhearted treatment he receives on any of his voyages. The #X_0# do not exploit him for personal or political reasons, as the Lilliputians do, and his life there is one of satisfaction and quietude. But the #X_0# do treat #X_2# as a plaything. When he tries to speak seriously with the king of #Y_0# about #Y_1#, the king dismisses the English as odious vermin, showing that deep discussion is not possible for #X_2# here.

-- #X_0# --
Two races of miniature people whom #X_1# meets on his first voyage. #X_0# are prone to conspiracies and jealousies, and while they treat #X_1# well enough materially, they are quick to take advantage of him in political intrigues of various sorts. The two races have been in a longstanding war with each over the interpretation of a reference in their common holy scripture to the proper way to eat eggs. #X_1# helps the #X_0# defeat the Blefuscudian navy, but he eventually leaves #Y_0# and receives a warm welcome in the court of Blefuscu, by which #X_2# satirizes the arbitrariness of international relations.

-- #X_0# --
Absentminded intellectuals who live on the floating island of Laputa, encountered by #X_1# on his third voyage. The #X_0# are parodies of theoreticians, who have scant regard for any practical results of their own research. They are so inwardly absorbed in their own thoughts that they must be shaken out of their meditations by special servants called flappers, who shake rattles in their ears. During #X_1#’s stay among them, they do not mistreat him, but are generally unpleasant and dismiss him as intellectually deficient. They do not care about down-to-earth things like the dilapidation of their own houses, but worry intensely about abstract matters like the trajectories of comets and the course of the sun. They are dependent in their own material needs on the land below them, called Lagado, above which they hover by virtue of a magnetic field, and from which they periodically raise up food supplies. In the larger context of #X_1#’s journeys, the #X_0# are a parody of the excesses of theoretical pursuits and the uselessness of purely abstract knowledge.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s wife, whose perfunctory mention in the first paragraphs of #X_0#’s Travels demonstrates how unsentimental and unemotional #X_0# is. He makes no reference to any affection for his wife, either here or later in his travels when he is far away from her, and his detachment is so cool as to raise questions about his ability to form human attachments. When he returns to #Y_0#, she is merely one part of his former existence, and he records no emotion even as she hugs him wildly. The most important facts about her in #X_0#’s mind are her social origin and the income she generates.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s cousin, self-proclaimed intimate friend, and the editor and publisher of #X_1#’s Travels. It was in #X_0#’s name that #X_2# arranged for the publication of his narrative, thus somewhat mixing the fictional and actual worlds. #X_0# is the fictional author of the prefatory note to #X_1#’s Travels, entitled “The Publisher to the Readers.” This note justifies #X_0#’s elimination of nearly half of the original manuscript material on the grounds that it was irrelevant, a statement that #X_4# includes so as to allow us to doubt #X_1#’s overall wisdom and ability to distinguish between important facts and trivial details.

-- #X_0# --
An eminent #Y_3# surgeon under whom #X_2# serves as an apprentice after graduating from #Y_1#. #X_0# helps get #X_2# his first job as a ship’s surgeon and then offers to set up a practice with him. After #X_0#’s death, #X_2# has trouble maintaining the business, a failure that casts doubt on his competence, though he himself has other explanations for the business’s failure. #X_0# is hardly mentioned in the travels, though he is surely at least as responsible for #X_2#’s welfare as some of the more exotic figures #X_2# meets. Nevertheless, #X_2# fleshes out figures such as the queen of #Y_0# much more thoroughly in his narrative, underscoring the sharp contrast between his reticence regarding #Y_2# and his long-windedness about foreigners.

-- #X_0# --
The commander of the ship on which #X_1# first sails, the Swallow. Traveling to the Levant, or the eastern Mediterranean, and beyond, #X_1# spends three and a half years on #X_0#’s ship. Virtually nothing is mentioned about #X_0#, which heightens our sense that #X_1#’s fascination with exotic types is not matched by any interest in his fellow countrymen.

-- #X_0# --
The master of the Antelope, the ship on which #X_1# embarks for the South Seas at the outset of his first journey, in 1699. When the Antelope sinks, #X_1# is washed ashore on Lilliput. No details are given about the personality of #X_0#, and he is not important in #X_1#’s life or in the unfolding of the novel’s plot. That #X_1# takes pains to name him accurately reinforces our impression that he is obsessive about facts but not always reliable in assessing overall significance.

-- #X_0# --
The Lord High Treasurer of Lilliput, who conceives a jealous hatred for Gulliver when he starts believing that his wife is having an affair with him. #X_0# is clearly paranoid, since the possibility of a love affair between Gulliver and a Lilliputian is wildly unlikely. #X_0# is a portrait of the weaknesses of character to which any human is prone but that become especially dangerous in those who wield great power.

-- #X_0# --
The Principal Secretary of Private Affairs in #Y_0#, who explains to #X_2# the history of the political tensions between the two principal parties in the realm, #Y_1# and #Y_2#. #X_0#is more a source of much-needed information for #X_2# than a well-developed personality, but he does display personal courage and trust in allowing #X_2# to hold him in his palm while he talks politics. Within the convoluted context of #Y_0#’s factions and conspiracies, such friendliness reminds us that fond personal relations may still exist even in this overheated political climate.

-- #X_0# --
The High Admiral of #Y_0#, who is the only member of the administration to oppose #X_1#’s liberation. #X_1# imagines that #X_0#’s enmity is simply personal, though there is no apparent reason for such hostility. Arguably, #X_0#’s hostility may be merely a tool to divert #X_1# from the larger system of #Y_0#ian exploitation to which he is subjected.

-- #X_0# --
Also known as #Y_1#, a #Y_0#ian political group reminiscent of the British Tories. #X_0# policies are said to be more agreeable to the ancient constitution of #Y_0#, and while #Y_1# appear greater in number than the Low-Heels, their power is lesser. Unlike the king, the crown prince is believed to sympathize with the #X_0#,  wearing one low heel and one high heel, causing him  to limp slightly.

-- #X_0# --
#Y_1#, a #Y_0#ian political group reminiscent of the British Whigs. The king has ordained that all governmental administrators must be selected from this party, much to the resentment of #X_1# of the realm. Thus, while there are fewer #X_0# than Tramecksan in #Y_0#, their political power is greater. The king’s own sympathies with the #X_0# are evident in the slightly lower heels he wears at court.

-- #X_0# --
The Prince of #Y_0#, the title character, and the protagonist. About thirty years old at the start of the play, #X_0# is the son of Queen #X_3# and the late King #X_0#, and the nephew of the present king, #X_2#. #X_0# is melancholy, bitter, and cynical, full of hatred for his uncle’s scheming and disgust for his mother’s sexuality. A reflective and thoughtful young man who has studied at #Y_1#, #X_0# is often indecisive and hesitant, but at other times prone to rash and impulsive acts.

-- #X_0# --
The King of #Y_0#, Hamlet’s uncle, and the play’s antagonist. The villain of the play, #X_0# is a calculating, ambitious politician, driven by his sexual appetites and his lust for power, but he occasionally shows signs of guilt and human feeling—his love for #X_2#, for instance, seems sincere.

-- #X_0# --
The Queen of #Y_0#, #X_2#’s mother, recently married to Claudius. #X_0# loves #X_2# deeply, but she is a shallow, weak woman who seeks affection and status more urgently than moral rectitude or truth.

-- #X_0# --
The Lord Chamberlain of Claudius’s court, a pompous, conniving old man. #X_0# is the father of Laertes and Ophelia.

-- #X_0# --
Hamlet’s close friend, who studied with the prince at the university in Wittenberg. #X_0# is loyal and helpful to Hamlet throughout the play. After Hamlet’s death, #X_0# remains alive to tell Hamlet’s story.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s daughter, a beautiful young woman with whom #X_1# has been in love. #X_0# is a sweet and innocent young girl, who obeys her father and her brother, Laertes. Dependent on men to tell her how to behave, she gives in to #X_2#’s schemes to spy on #X_1#. Even in her lapse into madness and death, she remains maidenly, singing songs about flowers and finally drowning in the river amid the flower garlands she had gathered.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s son and #X_1#’s brother, a young man who spends much of the play in #Y_0#. Passionate and quick to action, #X_0# is clearly a foil for the reflective Hamlet.

-- #X_0# --
The young Prince of #Y_1#, whose father the king (also named #X_0#) was killed by #X_2#’s father (also named #X_2#). Now #X_0# wishes to attack #Y_0# to avenge his father’s honor, making him another foil for Prince #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# specter of #X_2#’s recently deceased father. #X_0# ghost, who claims to have been murdered by #X_1#, calls upon #X_2# to avenge him. However, it is not entirely certain whether the ghost is what it appears to be, or whether it is something else. #X_2# speculates that the ghost might be a devil sent to deceive him and tempt him into murder, and the question of what the ghost is or where it comes from is never definitively resolved.

-- #X_0# --
Two slightly bumbling courtiers, former friends of #X_3# from Wittenberg, who are summoned by #X_1# and #X_2# to discover the cause of #X_3#’s strange behavior.

-- #X_0# --
The foolish courtier who summons Hamlet to his duel with Laertes.

-- #X_0# --
Courtiers whom Claudius sends to Norway to persuade the king to prevent Fortinbras from attacking.

-- #X_0# --
The officers who first see the ghost walking the ramparts of Elsinore and who summon Horatio to witness it. #X_0# is present when Hamlet first encounters the ghost.

-- #X_0# --
A soldier and guardsman at #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
Polonius’s servant, who is sent to France by Polonius to check up on and spy on Laertes.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator and protagonist of The Handmaid’s Tale. #X_0# belongs to the class of #X_4#, fertile women forced to bear children for elite, barren couples. #X_4# show which #X_2# owns them by adopting their #X_2#s’ names, such as #X_3#, and preceding them with “Of.” #X_0# remembers her real name but never reveals it. She no longer has family or friends, though she has flashbacks to a time in which she had a daughter and a husband named #X_5#. The cruel physical and psychological burdens of her daily life in #Y_0# torment her and pervade her narrative.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the head of the household where #X_2# works as a #X_1#. He initiates an unorthodox relationship with #X_2#, secretly playing Scrabble with her in his study at night. He often seems a decent, well-meaning man, and #X_2# sometimes finds that she likes him in spite of herself. He almost seems a victim of #Y_0#, making the best of a society he opposes. However, we learn from various clues and from the epilogue that the #X_0# was actually involved in designing and establishing #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# Wife, #X_0# worked in pre-#Y_0# days as a gospel singer, then as an anti-feminist activist and crusader for “traditional values.” In #Y_0#, she sits at the top of the female social ladder, yet she is desperately unhappy. #X_0#’s unhappiness shows that her restrictive, male-dominated society cannot bring happiness even to its most pampered and powerful women. #X_0# jealously guards her claims to status and behaves cruelly toward the #X_1# in her household.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s best friend from college, #X_0# is a lesbian and a staunch feminist; she embodies female resourcefulness and independence. Her defiant nature contrasts starkly with the behavior of the other women in the novel. Rather than passively accept her fate as a #X_1#, she makes several escape attempts and finally manages to get away from #Y_1#. However, she is caught before she can get out of #Y_0#. Later, #X_2# encounters #X_0# working as a prostitute in a club for the Commanders. At the club, #X_0# seems resigned to her fate, which suggests that a totalitarian society can grind down and crush even the most resourceful and independent people.

The #X_0#s are the class of women assigned to indoctrinate the #X_3# with the beliefs of the new society and make them accept their fates. #X_0# works at the “Red Center,” the re‑education center where #X_4# and other women go for instruction before becoming #X_3#. Although she appears only in #X_4#’s flashbacks, #X_0# and her instructions haunt #X_4# in her daily life. #X_0#’s slogans and maxims drum the ideology of the new society into the heads of the women, until even those like #X_4#, women who do not truly believe in the ideology, hear #X_2#’s words echoing in their heads.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a Guardian, a low-level officer of #Y_1# assigned to the Commander’s home, where he works as a gardener and chauffeur. He and #X_2# have a sexual chemistry that they get to satisfy when #X_3# orchestrates an encounter between them in an effort to get #X_2# pregnant. After sleeping together once, they begin a covert sexual affair. #X_0# is not just a Guardian; he may work either as a member of the #X_1#, #Y_1#’s secret police, or as a member of the underground Mayday resistance, or both. At the end of the novel, #X_0# orchestrates #X_2#’s escape from the Commander’s home, but we do not know whether he puts her into the hands of the #X_1# or the resistance.

-- #X_0# --
Another Handmaid who is #X_1#’s shopping partner and a member of the subversive “#Y_0#” underground. At the end of the novel, #X_0# is found out, and she hangs herself rather than face torture and reveal the names of her co-conspirators.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# works as a servant in the #X_1#’s household. She belongs to the class of #X_2#s, infertile women who do not qualify for the high status of #Y_0# and so work in domestic roles. #X_0# seems more content with her role than her fellow #X_2#, #X_5#. She hopes that #X_4# will be able to conceive, because then she will have a hand in raising a child.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# knows #X_0# from their time at #Y_0#. After #X_0# becomes a Handmaid, she takes the name #X_4#. She has a baby, which makes her the envy of all the other Handmaids in the area, but the baby later turns out to be deformed—an “Unbaby”—and there are rumors that her doctor fathered the child. #X_0# is a conformist, always ready to go along with what #X_2# demands of her, and so she endears herself to the #X_1# and to all authority figures. #X_3# holds #X_0# in contempt for taking the easy way out.

-- #X_0# --
In the days before #Y_1#, #X_0# had an affair with #X_1# while he was married to another woman, then got a divorce and became #X_1#’s husband. When #Y_1# comes to power, he attempts to escape to #Y_0# with #X_1# and their daughter, but they are captured. He is separated from #X_1#, and the couple never see one another again. The kind of love they shared is prohibited in #Y_1#, and #X_1#’s memories of #X_0# contrast with the regimented, passionless state of male-female relations in the new society.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# remembers her #X_0# in flashbacks to her pre-#Y_0# world—she was a single parent and a feminist activist. One day during her education at #Y_1#, #X_1# sees a video of her #X_0# as a young woman, yelling and carrying a banner in an anti-rape march called Take Back the Night. She embodies everything the architects of #Y_0# want to stamp out.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The guest speaker at the symposium that takes place in the epilogue to The Handmaid’s Tale. He and another academic, working at a university in the year 2195, transcribed #X_1#’s recorded narrative; his lecture details the historical significance of the story that we have just read.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist, and is married to #X_1#. #X_0# is buried in a mound of earth that grows higher each day as #X_1# lies in a hole behind her. She fills up her days with talk that #X_1# ignores, rituals with implements from her black bag, and with the nearly constant optimistic proclamation that today will be a "happy day."

-- #X_0# --
Married to #X_1# and is her foil. #X_0# crawls in and out of his hole behind her and is generally off-stage. He ignores #X_1# most of the time, either sleeping or reading his newspaper.

-- #X_0# --
An imaginary couple that #X_1# conjures up. #X_1# sees them as holding hands and holding bags in their free hands, while they watch and discuss #X_1#'s condition.

-- #X_0# --
A young girl. #X_1# tells #X_0#'s story about undressing her doll in the middle of the night. It is unclear if #X_0# is the young #X_1#, or a pure fantasy.

-- #X_0# --
A wealthy, retired merchant in #Y_0#, #Y_1#; he later becomes a Member of #Y_2#. Mr. #X_0# espouses a philosophy of rationalism, self-interest, and cold, hard fact. He describes himself as an “eminently practical” man, and he tries to raise his children—#X_3#, #X_5#, #X_2#, #X_1#, and #X_4#—to be equally practical by forbidding the development of their imaginations and emotions.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s daughter, later #X_1#’s wife. Confused by her coldhearted upbringing, #X_0# feels disconnected from her emotions and alienated from other people. While she vaguely recognizes that her father’s system of education has deprived her childhood of all joy, #X_0# cannot actively invoke her emotions or connect with others. Thus she marries #X_1# to please her father, even though she does not love her husband. Indeed, the only person she loves completely is her brother #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
. #X_2#’s eldest son and an apprentice at #Y_0# bank, who is generally called #X_5#. #X_5# reacts to his strict upbringing by becoming a dissipated, hedonistic, hypocritical young man. Although he appreciates his sister’s affection, #X_5# cannot return it entirely—he loves money and gambling even more than he loves #X_3#. These vices lead him to rob #Y_0# bank and implicate #X_4# as the robbery’s prime suspect.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s friend and later #X_3#’s husband. #X_0# claims to be a self-made man and boastfully describes being abandoned by his mother as a young boy. From his childhood poverty he has risen to become a banker and factory owner in #Y_0#, known by everyone for his wealth and power. His true upbringing, by caring and devoted parents, indicates that his social mobility is a hoax and calls into question the whole notion of social mobility in nineteenth-century #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of a clown in #X_4#’s circus. #X_3# is taken in by #X_1# when her father disappears. #X_3# serves as a foil, or contrast, to #X_2#: while #X_3# is imaginative and compassionate, #X_2# is rational and, for the most part, unfeeling. #X_3# embodies the Victorian femininity that counterbalances mechanization and industry. Through #X_3#’s interaction with her, #X_2# is able to explore her more sensitive, feminine sides.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s housekeeper, who goes to live at the bank apartments when #X_1# marries #X_2#. Once a member of the aristocratic elite, #X_0# fell on hard times after the collapse of her marriage. A selfish, manipulative, dishonest woman, #X_0# cherishes secret hopes of ruining #X_1#’s marriage so that she can marry him herself. #X_0#’s aristocratic background is emphasized by the narrator’s frequent allusions to her “Roman” and “Coriolanian” appearance.

-- #X_0# --
A Hand in #Y_0#’s factory. #X_0# loves #X_1# but is unable to marry her because he is already married, albeit to a horrible, drunken woman. A man of great honesty, compassion, and integrity, #X_0# maintains his moral ideals even when he is shunned by his fellow workers and fired by #Y_0#. #X_0#’s values are similar to those endorsed by  the narrator.

-- #X_0# --
A sophisticated and manipulative young #Y_1# gentleman who comes to #Y_0# to enter politics as a disciple of #X_1#, simply because he thinks it might alleviate his boredom. In his constant search for a new form of amusement, #X_0# quickly becomes attracted to #X_2# and resolves to seduce her.

-- #X_0# --
The lisping proprietor of the circus where #X_2#’s father was an entertainer. Later, #X_0# #X_3# hides Tom #X_1# and helps him flee the country. #X_0# #X_3# and his troop of entertainers value laughter and fantasy whereas #X_0# #X_1# values rationality and fact.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is one of the successes produced by #X_2#’s rationalistic system of education. Initially a bully at #X_2#’s school, #X_0# later becomes an employee and a spy at #X_1#’s bank. An uncharacteristically pale character and unrelenting disciple of fact, #X_0# almost stops #X_3# from fleeing after it is discovered that #X_3# is the true bank robber.

-- #X_0# --
The unpleasant teacher at #X_1#’s school. As his name suggests, #X_0# is not overly fond of children, and stifles or chokes their imaginations and feelings.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother, unbeknownst as such to all except herself and #X_1#. #X_0# makes an annual visit to #Y_0# in order to admire her son’s prosperity from a safe distance. #X_0#’s appearance uncovers the hoax that her son #X_1# has been attesting throughout the story, which is that he is a self-made man who was abandoned as a child.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s whiny, anemic wife, who constantly tells her children to study their “ologies” and complains that she’ll “never hear the end” of any complaint. Although #X_0#does not share her husband’s interest in facts, she lacks the energy and the imagination to oppose his system of education.

-- #X_0# --
The crooked orator who convinces the #Y_0# to unionize and turns them against #X_2# when he refuses to join the union.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The son of #X_1# and Hazel #X_0#. Fourteen years old and seven feet tall, #X_0# seems to be the most advanced model the human species can produce. He is a genius who is also absurdly strong, a dancer who can also break out of prison, and a self-proclaimed emperor. If #X_0# can’t succeed in overthrowing the government, #X_3# suggests, no one can. #X_0#’s assassination on live television means that the last, best hope of Americans has failed and there is no longer any chance of escaping the laws of equality.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s father and #X_2#’s husband. To counteract his physical strength, #X_0# must wear weights around his neck. #X_0#, an intelligent man, must also wear a radio that prohibits him from thinking deeply. The noises broadcast at twenty-second intervals by this radio interfere with #X_0#’s natural tendency toward intense thought. Despite his pensive nature, #X_0# is not bold. He believes in obeying the law and avoiding risks. He is also emotionally barren, urging his wife to forget her sadness and reacting to his son’s televised adventure by going to the kitchen for a beer.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s mother and #X_1#’s wife. Scatterbrained, dumb, and helpless, #X_0# is also sweet and well intentioned. For every nonsensical comment she makes about the wonderful work the Handicapper General is doing or the commendable effort made by the incompetents on television, she makes a kind remark to #X_1# or sheds a few tears for her son’s plight. #X_0# is characterized as an average American.

-- #X_0# --
The Handicapper General of #Y_0#. #X_0# is in charge of dumbing down and disabling those who are above average. It is her minions who enforce the handicap laws and create new hindrances for superior beings such as #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A dancer. #X_1# and #X_2# can see that she is the best ballerina because she wears an immense amount of weight. She also wears a terrible mask to cover up what must be extreme beauty. When the announcer gives her the news to read, she speaks briefly in a beautiful voice before apologizing and making her voice ugly.

-- #X_0# --
A dancer, possibly the same character as the ballerina-turned-announcer. This dancer becomes #X_2#’s empress after he says the first woman to stand will be his mate. After #X_2# removes her mental handicap, weights, and mask, she performs a lovely dance with him before being killed by #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --

Principled and fond of rules, #X_0# unwillingly follows the boys on their illicit adventures in order to unravel the mystery of #Y_0#.

This notion infuriates #X_2#, who tries to get #X_0# fired from the position of headmaster.

-- #X_0# --
Slimy, smirking, and snobby, #X_0# is #X_1#'s greatest #Y_0# nemesis. Because his family is very wealthy, he is able to buy himself a position on the #Y_1# team, but even though he has the fastest broomstick, he cannot play the game well.

He is loyal to #X_1#, and belligerent to their enemy, #X_2#. #X_0# uses experience and a process of trial-and-error to solve most mysteries. #X_0#'s character is often overshadowed by #X_1#'s, but #X_0# always manages to succeed.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is always the top student in her class. She is clever and well-read. Most spells come easily to her and remain in her encyclopedic mind.. However, she is in principle a rule-follower, and so in this story she often alienates #X_1# and #X_3# by reporting or threatening to report them to Professor #X_2#, in cases such as #X_1#'s gift of the Firebolt, or his possession and use of the Marauder's map.

-- #X_0# --
Once a student who attended #Y_0# fifty years prior to #X_1#'s time, #X_0#molded himself into the most powerful dark wizard the world has ever seen. Twelve years before, he killed #X_1#'s parents and tried to kill #X_1#, only to have his curse backfire and render him powerless. It is generally believed that #X_3# turned #X_1#'s parents over to #X_0#, although in truth, #X_2# is guilty.

Once #X_3# best friend, now an escaped convict from the wizard prison Azkaban, #X_0# is suspected to be the cause of twelve Muggle deaths as well as the indirect cause of the deaths of #X_2#'s parents. He is a threat on the frontier of this story, one of the premier good wizards turned bad, although in the end he is revealed to be innocent in addition to being #X_2#'s godfather. Also, #X_0# is able to transform himself at will into #X_4#, a large black dog that #X_2# mistakes for the #X_1#. One of the creators of the Marauder's Map.

-- #X_0# --
The gamekeeper at #Y_0# and a good friend of #X_3#'s, #X_0# is a giant, hairy man with an inimitable accent, and he has a great liking for strange and dangerous creatures. In this book, he is the defender of Buckbeak, a hippogriff that is placed on trial for injuring #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The fourth in the group of friends that included #X_2# Potter, Sirius #X_1#, and #X_5#, #X_0# betrayed #X_4# and #X_2#, turning their whereabouts over the #X_9#, then blowing up a dozen Muggles, framing #X_1# and turning himself into a rat so that he could escape. Another of the creators of the Marauder's Map. Disguised as #X_7#, he has lived many years as #X_6#'s pet rat.

-- #X_0# --

A slimy, smirking, and snotty boy from #Y_1#, #X_0# is #X_3#'s greatest #Y_0# nemesis (not counting #X_4#, who usually resides outside #Y_0#). Because his family is very wealthy and influential, #X_0# is able to use his father's power as an intimidation tactic, in this book when he tries to have #X_2# fired and #X_1# executed.

One of #X_3#'s older brothers, #X_0# is a beater for the #Y_0# Quidditch team, and a good solid troublemaker when paired with his twin brother, #X_1#. #X_0# has the slightly louder, more over-the-top sense of humor of the two, but they are identical and usually inseparable. He and his brother #X_1# are responsible for passing the Marauder's Map onto #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_2#'s older brothers, #X_0# is a beater for the #Y_0# Quidditch team, and a good solid troublemaker when paired with his twin brother, #X_1#. He is somewhat subtler and more tongue-in-cheek than his twin, but otherwise, for the most part identical. Together, the #X_0# twins are an infamous, amusing, and charming pair.

The protagonist of the story, who is gradually transformed from timid weakling to powerful hero by the end. Marked on the forehead with a lightning-shaped scar, #X_0# is marked also by the confrontation between good and bad magic that caused that scar: the standoff between the evil #X_1# and his parents who died to save their son. The story eventually becomes a tale of #X_0#’s vengeance for their wrongful deaths. As he matures, he shows himself to be caring and shrewd, a loyal friend, and an excellent Quidditch player.

-- #X_0# --
Initially an annoying goody-two-shoes who studies too much and obeys the school rules too zealously. #X_0# eventually becomes friendly with #X_1# after she learns to value friendship over perfectionism and obedience. She comes from a purely Muggle family, and her character illustrates the social-adjustment problems often faced by new students at #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A shy, modest boy who comes from an impoverished wizard family. #X_0# is #X_1#’s first friend at #Y_0#, and they become close. He lacks #X_1#’s gusto and charisma, but his loyalty and help are useful to #X_1# throughout their adventures. #X_0#’s mediocrity despite his wizard background reminds us that  success at #Y_0# is based solely on talent and hard work, not on family connections. #X_0#’s willingness to be beaten up by the monstrous chess queen shows how selfless and generous he is.

-- #X_0# --
An oafish giant who works as a groundskeeper at #Y_0#. Rubeus #X_0# is a well-meaning creature with more kindness than brains. He cares deeply for #X_3#, as evidenced by the tears he sheds upon having to leave the infant #X_3# with the #X_2#. His fondness for animals is endearing, even if it gets him into trouble (as when he tries raising a dragon at home). #X_0# symbolizes the importance of generosity and human warmth in a world menaced by conniving villains.

-- #X_0# --
The kind, wise head of #Y_0#. Though he is a famous wizard, #X_0# is as humble and adorable as his name suggests. While other school officials, such as Professor #X_2#, are obsessed with the rules, #X_0# respects them (as his warnings against entering #Y_1# remind us) but does not exaggerate their importance. He appears to have an almost superhuman level of wisdom, knowledge, and personal understanding, and it seems that he may have set up the whole quest for the Sorcerer’s Stone so that #X_1# could prove himself.

-- #X_0# --
A great wizard gone bad. When he killed #X_1#’s parents, #X_2# gave #X_1# a lightning-shaped scar. #X_2# has thus shaped #X_1#’s life so that #X_1#’s ultimate destruction of him appears as a kind of vengeance. #X_2#, whose name in French means either “flight of death” or “theft of death,” is associated both with high-flying magic and with deceit throughout the story. He is determined to escape death by finding the Sorcerer’s Stone. #X_2#’s weak point is that he cannot understand love, and thus cannot touch #X_1#’s body, which still bears the traces of #X_1#’s mother’s love for her son.

-- #X_0# --
An arrogant student and #X_1#’s nemesis. #X_0#, whose name translates roughly to “dragon of bad faith,” is a rich snob from a long line of wizards who feels entitled to the #Y_0# experience. He makes fun of the poorer #X_2# and advises #X_1# to choose his friends more carefully. As the story progresses, #X_0# becomes more and more inimical to #X_1# and his friends, and there is a hint that he may grow up to become another #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
A timid #Y_0# classmate of #X_1#’s. #X_0# is friendly and loyal, but like #X_3#, he lacks #X_1#’s charisma. Like #X_2#, he is initially too obedient, and when the time comes to go after the Sorcerer’s Stone, he fears punishment and threatens to report his friends to the teachers.

-- #X_0# --
The head of #Y_0# at Hogwarts and a high-ranking woman in the wizard world. Minerva #X_0# is fair but extremely stern and severe in her punishments. Her devotion to the letter of the law is impressive but a bit cold, and we constantly feel that she could never become a warm and wise figure like #X_1#. Rowling named her after a notoriously bad nineteenth-century Scottish poet named William #X_0# who was nevertheless highly confident of his own talents.

-- #X_0# --
A professor of Potions at #Y_0#. Severus #X_0# dislikes #X_1# and appears to be an evil man for most of the story. His name associates him not only with unfair snap judgments of others but also with his violent intentions to snap the bones of his enemies. #X_0#’s grudge against #X_1#, which is nevertheless far from a murderous ill will, helps us remember the difference between forgivable vices and unforgivable evil intentions.

-- #X_0# --
A stuttering and seemingly harmless man, and a professor of #Y_0# at #Y_1#. #X_0# appears as nervous and squirrelly as his name suggests for most of the story. It is he, for example, who nearly faints when announcing the news that a troll is loose in the school. It turns out later, however, that #X_0# has faked his withdrawing meekness and is actually a cold-blooded conniver.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s rich uncle, with whom #X_1# lives for ten miserable years. #X_0# symbolizes the Muggle world at its most silly and mediocre. It is through Mr. #X_0#’s jaded Muggle eyes that we first glimpse wizards, and his closed-mindedness toward the colorful cloaks and literate cats that he meets emphasizes how different the human and wizard worlds are.

-- #X_0# --
Mr. #X_0#’s wife. #X_0# is an overly doting mother to her spoiled son, #X_1#, and a prison-keeper to #X_2#. She is haughty and excessively concerned with what the neighbors think of her family. She is somewhat humanized for us when we discover that she was always jealous of the magical gifts of her sister, #X_3#, #X_2#’s witch mother. Perhaps her malevolence toward #X_2# springs from an earlier resentment of her sister.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s cousin, a spoiled, fat bully. Annoying and loud, #X_0# manipulates parental love to get what he wants—his outrageous desires for multiple television sets foreshadow the important scenes involving the Mirror of Erised and the wrongful desire for eternal life that motivates #X_3#. #X_0#’s tormenting of #X_1# foreshadows #X_2#’s later bullying tendencies at #Y_0#, though he is less gifted than #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The thirteen-year-old protagonist in the novel. #X_0# undergoes a difficult transition when his parents file for divorce. The memories of the divorce, fresh and painful, plague him throughout the book, although less so the more time passes. An incredibly dynamic character, he starts out as a #Y_0# boy who takes for granted the daily conveniences of urban life, and transforms himself into a man of the wilderness, completely self-sufficient and very knowledgeable about his surrounding natural environment. His respect and love for nature only grow with time, as does his ability to come to terms with his parents' divorce.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#wants to get a divorce from #X_0# father, as she is seeing another man, whom #X_1# does not know, but calls "the man with short blond hair." His #X_0# has no idea that #X_1# knows about the affair, which he calls "The Secret." She attempts to talk to #X_1# about his moodiness, but he refuses to tell her that he knows about her affair. She gives the hatchet to #X_1# when he departs for the Canadian woods, and he senses her vulnerability during this time, as well as her frustration about #X_0# lack of communicativeness. #X_1# resents his #X_0# for her behavior.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#does not want a divorce from his mother. He is unaware that she is having an affair, and her wish for a divorce perplexes him. At no point in the novel can #X_1# bring himself to tell his #X_0# "The Secret." #X_0#appeared in one of his dreams, giving him hints as to how to start a fire.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s good friend back in #Y_0#. #X_0# was riding his bicycle when #X_1# saw his mother kiss the strange man. #X_1# used to play in the park with #X_0#. He also appeared in one of #X_1#'s dreams, giving him hints as to how to start a fire.

-- #X_0# --
The pilot of the #Y_0# plane. He is a man in his mid-forties and the only other person on the plane.

-- #X_0# --

The protagonist and narrator of the novel. #X_0# is a sixteen-year-old black high school student who spends her life divided between the poor, primarily black neighborhood of Garden Heights and #Y_1#, a wealthy, primarily white school. #X_0# is analytical and sharp, but because she narrates events as she experiences them, her emotions are immediate and unfiltered. Traumatized after witnessing the fatal shooting of her friend #X_1#, #X_0# blames herself for not being there for #X_1# prior to his death. As #X_0# gains the courage to testify at the grand jury hearing for #Y_0# and grapples with how being black affects all aspects of her life, she grows more outspoken, refusing to accept the way racism hurts her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_5#’s childhood best friend who is shot by #Y_0# during a traffic stop. After #X_0#’s death, rumors spread that #X_0# dealt drugs and participated in the #X_4# Lords gang, placing his character in question. However, #X_5# remembers #X_0# primarily as the sweet friend she knew growing up. #X_3# and #X_2# attest that #X_0# often spoke fondly of #X_5#, and that he cared about her very much. Toward the end of the novel, #X_2# reveals that #X_0# took great care of his family and only sold drugs to pay off his mother’s debt to #X_4#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#, #X_3#, and #X_2#’s father, an outspoken and philosophical man who runs a small grocery store in #Y_0#. Despite his dark past as a member of the #Y_1# gang and a short stint in prison, #X_0# is an engaged father who devotes himself fully to his family and his neighborhood. #X_0# inspires #X_4# by educating her on Black Power philosophy, but he struggles with balancing his values of black liberation with the reality that those values put him and his family in danger. His strong beliefs often get him into arguments with #X_5#, who helped care for #X_0#’s children while #X_0# was in prison.

-- #X_0# --
Mother to #X_4# and #X_2#, and step-mother to #X_3#. #X_0# is a nurse and a loving but firm mother.

She fiercely protects her children and always reminds her husband, #X_1#, not to push the children too far into dangerous activism.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s maternal uncle, a police officer. #X_0# served as a father figure in #X_3#’s life, particularly while #X_2# was in prison.

–1915) --
An influential and controversial black leader and founder of #Y_2# in #Y_0#. #X_2# believes blacks will succeed through education, not through political agitation.

-- #X_0# --
A great intellectual figure and editor of #Y_2#, the #Y_0#’s magazine. #X_0# #X_0# is a good-looking man with a mustache and intelligent eyes. Some think his approach is too fast and threatening. He always stays with #X_3# and his wife when he visits #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A deaf-mute who makes a living engraves silver pieces in a jewelry shop. Mr. #X_0# is tall and thin, with intelligent gray eyes. He almost always keeps his hands thrust deep into his pockets.

-- #X_0# --
A deaf-mute who is #X_2#'s best friend. #X_0# and #X_2# live together for more than ten years until #X_0# is sent to an insane asylum at the beginning of the story. He is fat, greasy, and lazy, never signing anything with his hands unless he is talking about eating, drinking, or sleeping.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
A heavy-drinking, ranting man who comes into town and frequents Mr. #X_1#'s café. #X_0# is a bizarre looking man: short, but with long arms, large hands, and a moustache that appears oddly detached from his somewhat distorted face.

-- #X_0# --
Dr. #X_1#'s daughter, who works as a servant in the #X_2# household. #X_0# is very loving and faithful, and she values her relationships with her family members very highly.

-- #X_0# --
Dr. #X_2#'s son and #X_3#'s brother, who works in the kitchen at Mr. #X_1#'s cafe. #X_0# always carries his trademark harmonica and plays it wherever he goes. He is a sweet young man, but not very bright, and he gets into trouble primarily by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s husband. #X_0# is a relatively minor character; we are told little about him save that he is good-natured and wears very loud outfits.

-- #X_0# --
Mick #X_0#'s younger brother and her favorite in the family. #X_0#, whose real name is #X_1#, is an intelligent boy who is small for his age.

-- #X_0# --
The youngest child in the #X_0# family. #X_0# is only a baby, and we are told almost nothing about him beyond the fact that #X_3# often pulls him and #X_2# around in a wagon.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s older brother, in his late teens. At the beginning of the novel, #X_0# is the sibling #X_3# looks up to the most. Later, however, she realizes that she and #X_0# are drifting apart, so she becomes much closer to #X_2#.

Dr. #X_1#'s father-in-law. #X_0# loves to ask Dr. #X_1# about remedies for his various aches and pains. He believes that on Judgment Day, God will finally have mercy on black people by making their skin white—an idea that Dr. #X_1# finds revolting and humiliating.

-- #X_0# --
Dr. #X_0#'s two eldest sons. #X_0# and #X_2# are estranged from their father, who is disappointed that they have not become the distinguished, well- educated men he had hoped they would.

-- #X_0# --
Dr. #X_0#'s former wife, who is now deceased. #X_0# was a beautiful, gentle woman with honey-colored skin. Though Dr. #X_0# tried to get his wife to share his radical political views, she never did, which was often a source of frustration to the doctor.

-- #X_0# --
A black pharmacist friend of Dr. #X_2#. Mr. #X_0# urges #X_3# not to become involved when Willie #X_2# gets in trouble.

A con artist who passes through town and preys on the black population by selling them false "government pensions." #X_0# is caught by the police, but not until after he has spent or hidden all his money.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of Heart of Darkness. #X_0# is philosophical, independent-minded, and generally skeptical of those around him. He is also a master storyteller, eloquent and able to draw his listeners into his tale. Although #X_0# shares many of his fellow Europeans’ prejudices, he has seen enough of the world and has encountered enough debased white men to make him skeptical of imperialism.

-- #X_0# --
The chief of #Y_0# and the object of #X_1#’s quest. #X_0# is a man of many talents—we learn, among other things, that he is a gifted musician and a fine painter—the chief of which are his charisma and his ability to lead men. #X_0# is a man who understands the power of words, and his writings are marked by an eloquence that obscures their horrifying message. Although he remains an enigma even to #X_1#, #X_0# clearly exerts a powerful influence on the people in his life. His downfall seems to be a result of his willingness to ignore the hypocritical rules that govern European colonial conduct: #X_0# has “kicked himself loose of the earth” by fraternizing excessively with the natives and not keeping up appearances; in so doing, he has become wildly successful but has also incurred the wrath of his fellow white men.

-- #X_0# --
The chief agent of the #Y_0# in its African territory, who runs #Y_1#. He owes his success to a hardy constitution that allows him to outlive all his competitors. He is average in appearance and unremarkable in abilities, but he possesses a strange capacity to produce uneasiness in those around him, keeping everyone sufficiently unsettled for him to exert his control over them.

-- #X_0# --
The brickmaker, whom #X_1# also meets at #Y_0#, is a favorite of the manager and seems to be a kind of corporate spy. He never actually produces any bricks, as he is supposedly waiting for some essential element that is never delivered. He is petty and conniving and assumes that other people are too.

-- #X_0# --
An efficient worker with an incredible habit of dressing up in spotless whites and keeping himself absolutely tidy despite the squalor and heat of #Y_0#, where he lives and works. He is one of the few colonials who seems to have accomplished anything: he has trained a native woman to care for his wardrobe.

-- #X_0# --
The bumbling, greedy agents of #Y_0#. They carry long wooden staves with them everywhere, reminding #X_1# of traditional religious travelers. They all want to be appointed to a station so that they can trade for ivory and earn a commission, but none of them actually takes any effective steps toward achieving this goal. They are obsessed with keeping up a veneer of civilization and proper conduct, and are motivated entirely by self-interest. They hate the natives and treat them like animals, although in their greed and ridiculousness they appear less than human themselves.

-- #X_0# --
Natives hired as the crew of the steamer, a surprisingly reasonable and well-tempered bunch. #X_1# respects their restraint and their calm acceptance of adversity. The leader of the group, in particular, seems to be intelligent and capable of ironic reflection upon his situation.

-- #X_0# --
A #X_0# sailor who has gone into the African interior as the trading representative of a Dutch company. He is boyish in appearance and temperament, and seems to exist wholly on the glamour of youth and the audacity of adventurousness. His brightly patched clothes remind #X_2# of a harlequin. He is a devoted disciple of #X_1#’s.

-- #X_0# --
A young man from the coast trained by #X_1#’s predecessor to pilot the steamer. He is a serviceable pilot, although #X_1# never comes to view him as much more than a mechanical part of the boat. He is killed when the steamer is attacked by natives hiding on the riverbanks.

-- #X_0# --
A fiercely beautiful woman loaded with jewelry who appears on the shore when #X_2#’s steamer arrives at and leaves #Y_0#. She seems to exert an undue influence over both #X_1# and the natives around the station, and the Russian trader points her out as someone to fear. Like #X_1#, she is an enigma: she never speaks to #X_2#, and he never learns anything more about her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# naïve and long-suffering fiancée, whom #X_2# goes to visit after #X_0# death. Her unshakable certainty about #X_0# love for her reinforces #X_2#’s belief that women live in a dream world, well insulated from reality.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s doting relative, who secures him a position with the #Y_0#. She believes firmly in imperialism as a charitable activity that brings civilization and religion to suffering, simple savages. She, too, is an example for #X_1# of the naïveté and illusions of women.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s friends, who are with him #X_0# a ship on the Thames at the story’s opening. #X_0#y are the audience for the central story of Heart of Darkness, which #X_1# narrates. All have been sailors at one time or another, but all now have important jobs ashore and have settled into middle-class, middle-aged lives. #X_0#y represent the kind of man #X_1# would have likely become had he not gone to Africa: well-meaning and moral but ignorant as to a large part of the world beyond #Y_0#. #X_0# narrator in particular seems to be shaken by #X_1#’s story. He repeatedly com#X_0#ts on its obscurity and #X_1#’s own mysterious nature.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s predecessor as captain of the steamer. #X_0#, by all accounts a good-tempered, nonviolent man, was killed in a dispute over some hens, apparently after striking a village chief.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the daughter of the famous General #X_0#; as a child she was used to luxury and high-class living. As the play begins, she is returning from her honeymoon with #X_2#, a scholar with good prospects but not as much money as #X_0# is accustomed to. Her married name is #X_0# Tesman. #X_0# is an intelligent, unpredictable, and somewhat dishonest young woman who is not afraid to manipulate her husband and friends.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is an amiable, intelligent young scholar. He tries very hard to please his young wife, #X_2#, and often does not realize that she is manipulating him. In fact, he often seems foolish for his age, and when he annoys #X_2#, the audience has reason to sympathize with her. #X_0# is hoping for a professorship in history, and at the beginning of the play it seems that his one great rival, #X_1#, a notorious alcoholic, no longer stands in #X_0#'s way. #X_0# was raised by his Aunt #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0#, or #X_1#, is the aunt of Jürgen #X_0#. After #X_0#'s parents died, #X_1# raised him. She is well-meaning, and she is constantly hinting that #X_0# and #X_2# should have a baby. #X_1# tries to get along with #X_2#, but the difference in their class backgrounds is painfully apparent. #X_1# lives with the ailing Aunt #X_6#, another aunt of #X_0#'s.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a judge of relatively inferior rank. He is a friend of both #X_1#* and #Y_0#, and he visits their house regularly. He has connections around the city, and is often the first to give #X_1# information about alterations in the possibility of his professorship. He seems to enjoy meddling in other people's affairs. He is a worldly and cynical man.

-- #X_0# --
A genius, #X_0# Lövoborg is #Y_0#* biggest competitor in the academic world. After a series of scandals related to drinking, he was once a public outcast but has now returned to the city and has published a book to rave reviews. He also has another manuscript that is even more promising. Mrs. #X_2# helped him with both manuscripts. He once shared a close relationship with #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a meek but passionate woman. She and her husband hired #X_1# Lövborg as a tutor to their children, and #X_0# grew attached to #X_1#, acting as his personal secretary and aiding him in his research and writing. When #X_1# leaves her estate to return to the city, #X_0# comes to town and goes to #Y_0#* for help, fearing #X_1# will revert to his alcoholism. #X_0# went to school with #X_3# and remembers being tormented by her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_1#* and #X_2# Tesman's servant. Formerly, she was the servant in #X_4# household. She tries very hard to please #X_2#, her new mistress, but #X_2# is quite dissatisfied with her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is dying at the start of the play. She never appears onstage. She helped #X_0# #X_1# raise #X_2#*

-- #X_0# --
The ruling king of #Y_0#. #X_0# is not actually all that old, but at the time the play opens, he has been worn down prematurely by worries. He nurses guilty feelings about having won his throne through a civil war that deposed the former king, #X_2#. In addition, his reign has not brought an end to the internal strife in #Y_0#, which erupts into an even bigger civil war in this play. Finally, he is vexed by the irresponsible antics of his eldest son, Prince #X_1#. Regal, proud, and somewhat aloof, #X_0# #X_0# is not the main character of the play that bears his name but, rather, its historical focus. He gives the play a center of power and a sense of stability, though his actions and emotions are largely secondary to the plot.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#’s son, who will eventually become King #X_3# #X_0#’s title is #X_0# of Wales, but all of his friends call him #X_1#; he is also sometimes called #X_0# Monmouth. Though #X_0# spends all his time hanging around highwaymen, robbers, and whores, he has secret plans to transform himself into a noble prince, and his regal qualities emerge as the play unfolds. #X_0# is the closest thing the play has to a protagonist: his complex and impressive mind is generally at the center of the play, though #X_5# is often somewhat ambiguous about how we are meant to understand this simultaneously deceitful and heroic young prince.

-- #X_0# --
The son and heir of #X_6# and the nephew of #X_7#. #X_0#’s real name is #X_2# (he is also called #X_1# or #X_4#), but he has earned his nickname from his fierceness in battle and hastiness of action. #X_0# is a member of the powerful #X_4# family of the North, which helped bring #X_3# to power but now feels that the king has forgotten his debt to them. In #X_5#’s account, #X_0# is the same age as Prince #X_1# and becomes his archrival. Quick-tempered and impatient, #X_0# is obsessed with the idea of honor and glory to the exclusion of all other qualities.

-- #X_0# --
A fat old man between the ages of about fifty and sixty-five who hangs around in taverns on the wrong side of #Y_0# and makes his living as a thief, highwayman, and mooch. #X_0# is Prince #X_2#’s closest friend and seems to act as a sort of mentor to him, instructing him in the practices of criminals and vagabonds. He is the only one of the bunch who can match #X_2#’s quick wit pun for pun.

-- #X_0# --
A nobleman and military leader who is a close companion and valuable ally of King #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The younger son of King #X_3# and the younger brother of Prince #X_2#. #X_0# proves himself wise and valiant in battle, despite his youth.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father. #X_0# conspires and raises troops on the #X_3# side, but he claims that he is sick before the Battle of Shrewsbury and does not actually bring his troops into the fray.

-- #X_0# --
The Welsh rebel #X_4# son-in-law. #X_3# is a conflation of two separate historical figures: #X_3# and the #X_0# of #X_0#. For #X_6#’s purposes, #X_3# matters because he had a strong claim to the throne of #Y_0# before King #X_2# overthrew the previous king, #X_5#.

-- #X_0# --
The leader of the Welsh rebels and the father of Lady #X_1# (most editions of  1 Henry IV refer to him as #X_2#). #X_0# joins with the #X_3# in their insurrection against King Henry. Well-read, educated in #Y_0#, and very capable in battle, he is also steeped in the traditional lore of #Y_1# and claims to be able to command great magic. He is mysterious and superstitious and sometimes acts according to prophecies and omens.

-- #X_0# --
The leader of the large army of Scottish rebels against King #X_2#. Usually called “The #X_0#” (a traditional way of referring to a Scottish clan chief), the deadly and fearless #X_0# fights on the side of the #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
A relative and ally of the Earl of Worcester.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# archbishop, whose given name is #X_3#, has a grievance against King Henry and thus conspires on the side of the #X_2#.

Criminals and highwaymen. #X_0# #X_0# and #X_0# are friends of #X_2# and Prince #X_3# who drink with them in #Y_0#, accompany them in highway robbery, and go with them to war.

-- #X_0# --
Another highwayman friend of #X_2#, #X_1#, and the rest. #X_0# seems to be nicknamed after the place on the #Y_0# road—called Gad’s Hill—where he has set up many robberies.

-- #X_0# --
Hostess of #Y_1#, a seedy dive in Eastcheap, #Y_0#, where #X_1# and his friends go to drink.

-- #X_0# --
The ruling king of #Y_0# at the beginning of the play. His health declines throughout the play, in part due to his anxiety about civil insurrection and the fate of his seemingly irresponsible son, #X_1#. He dies before the end of the play, never having fulfilled his dream of leading a company of soldiers to fight in the Crusades in #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
Only called "#X_0#" by #X_1# and his friends, the prince is also called #X_0# #X_0#, #X_2#, #X_0# #X_2#, #X_2# Monmouth, the #X_0# of Wales, and, after his father's death, #X_0# #X_0# V. He is the play's main protagonist. His transformation from a youthful hell-raiser into the dignified #X_0# #X_0# V is one of the major psychological developments of the play.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
Usually called #X_0# but sometimes called #X_3#. A fat, cheerful, witty, aging criminal, he has long been Prince #X_1#'s mentor and close friend. He pretended to have killed #X_2# at the Battle of Shrewsbury, and Prince #X_1#--the actual killer--agreed to go along with the lie. For this reason, everyone gives #X_0# much more respect than he deserves.

-- #X_0# --
A boy whom Prince #X_2# has assigned to serve #X_1# as his page; he carries #X_1#'s sword and runs his errands.

-- #X_0# --

Northumberland's servant.

Dead before the play begins, he is often referred to in its early scenes. He was Northumberland's son and a leader of the rebellion against the king. He was also called #X_5# or #X_4#. Prince #X_3# killed him at the Battle of Shrewsbury, but everyone thinks that the killer was #X_2#.

Incompetent officers of the law upon whom Mistress #X_2# calls to arrest #X_1# in II.i.

-- #X_0# --
Middle-class country landowners who are also justices of the peace (minor local law officers). They are cousins. #X_0# is an old school friend of #X_1#'s.

-- #X_0# --
An honest, industrious, and talkative household servant of Justice #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The young, recently crowned king of #Y_0#. #X_0# is brilliant, focused, fearless, and committed to the responsibilities of kingship. These responsibilities often force him to place his personal feelings second to the needs of the crown. #X_0# is a brilliant orator who uses his skill to justify his claims and to motivate his troops. Once #X_0# has resolved to conquer #Y_1#, he pursues his goal relentlessly to the end.

-- #X_0# --
A single character who introduces each of the play’s five acts. Like the group of singers who comprised the chorus in Greek drama, the #X_0# in Henry V functions as a narrator offering commentary on the play’s plot and themes.

against King #X_1#.  --
#Y_0#, #X_2#, and #X_0# are bribed by French agents to kill #X_1# before he sets sail for #Y_1#. #X_2#’s betrayal of his king is particularly surprising, as #X_2# and #X_1# are good friends.

-- #X_0# --
Two noble cousins who die together at the Battle of Agincourt.

The Constable of #Y_4#, the Duke of Orléans, the Duke of #Y_1#, the Duke of Bourbon, the Earl of Grandpré, Lord #X_2#, #X_3#, and the Governor of #Y_5# are #X_0#. Most of them are killed or captured by the English at the Battle of #Y_0#, though #X_3# survives to help with the peace negotiations between #Y_4# and #Y_3#. Like the #X_1#, most of these #X_0# are more interested in making jokes about the English than in taking them seriously as a fighting force, a tendency that leads to the eventual #X_0# defeat at #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A wise, aged veteran of many wars who serves with Henry’s campaign.

-- #X_0# --
An army captain and a capable fighter who serves with Henry’s campaign.

The captains of King Henry’s troops from #Y_2#, #Y_0#, and #Y_1#, respectively, all of whom have heavy accents reflecting their countries of origin. #X_0#, a close friend of Captain #X_1#, is the most prominent of the three. His wordiness provides comic relief, but he is also very likable and is an intelligent leader and strategist.

-- #X_0# --
A commoner from #Y_0# who serves in the war with #X_3#, and a friend of #X_4# and #X_2#. #X_0# speaks with a blustery and melodramatic poetic diction; he is married to the hostess of #Y_1# in #Y_0#.

#X_0# #X_3#, and #X_1#  --

#X_0# #X_0#, the play's namesake. #X_0# begins the play under the powerful influence of Cardinal #X_9# and is easily persuaded to do away with #X_4#. #X_9# then convinces him that his marriage to the queen is illegal, since #X_8# was his brother's widow. So, #X_0# divorces #X_8#, intending to marry the beautiful #X_1# Bullen (the historical #X_1# Boleyn). He finally realizes that #X_9# is manipulating him when he intercepts letters between #X_9# and the Pope discussing his divorce. Angered, #X_0# strips #X_9# of his title and wealth, then marries #X_1# and announces it to the kingdom. #X_0# gains a more active role finally when his friend #X_5# is threatened by negative rumors. Giving his ring to #X_5#, the king watches the trial and intervenes to save #X_5# and to scold the lords of their court for their constant infighting. Father to the child (who will grow up to become the great Queen #X_6#), #X_0# concludes the play at her baptism, believing that bringing her into the world is the best thing he has done.

-- #X_0# --
The king's right-hand man, #X_0# is quite a schemer. He engineers a truce with #Y_0# before the play begins, then a break with #Y_1# when the king divorces #X_4#, who is the daughter of the king of #Y_1#. He plants the idea in #X_3#'s mind that his marriage to #X_4# is illegal because he wants #X_3# to marry the daughter of the king of #Y_0#, thus, solidifying the treaty he engineered. But he inadvertently introduces #X_1# Bullen to the king at a dinner, and #X_3# is smitten. In a letter, #X_0# tries to convince the Pope to deny #X_3# a divorce until #X_3# gets over his infatuation with #X_1#. But #X_3# intercepts the letter, along with an inventory of all the lands and holdings #X_0# has slowly been acquiring from fallen lords. #X_3#, enraged at #X_0#'s betrayal, fires him, removes his royal protection, and takes his possessions. #X_0# finally understands that he was wrong to have so much arrogance and realizes that he was out of his depth to be plotting the future of the kingdom as he saw fit. Finally understanding humility and honor to be the correct path, #X_0# sees the truth of his wrongdoing. Humbly, he leaves the court and dies soon after in a monastery.

-- #X_0# --
Married to King #X_3# VIII's brother before marrying #X_3#, #X_0#is present at the trial of #X_1#, and she is the only one who suspects any wrongdoing in the trial. When Cardinal #X_5# convinces the king to divorce her, she rails against #X_5# and accuses him of being her enemy. She refuses to let him judge her, and she will not submit to the divorce. When #X_5# comes to her, speaking kindly, she charges him with being a traitor and plotting to bring her down. She speaks at length of her loyal nature as a wife for more than 20 years, and she cannot believe she is being punished for it. If anything, she is being cast out for not giving birth to a male heir, nor to the future #X_0# #X_2#. When #X_0# is finally divorced, she is made "Princess Dowager." After hearing her attendants speak well of #X_5#, she forgives him and has a vision of her own imminent death.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# has just returned from #Y_0#, where he has developed a grudge against Cardinal #X_1#. He rails against #X_1# and complains that #X_1# unfairly influences the king. #X_1# orders him arrested. At his trial, #X_0# is accused of having plotted to gain the throne (having been informed that he had a tenuous link to it should the king die without an heir). #X_0# is executed.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is an unmarried lady when the king meets her at Cardinal #X_5#'s dinner party. He is much impressed with her and apparently has her in mind throughout his divorce proceedings. #X_0#, speaking with one of her attendants about #X_3#'s misery during the divorce, declares that she would never want to be the queen. Yet she marries #X_2#, though the Pope has not consented to #X_2# and #X_4#'s divorce. Later, she gives birth to the child #X_1#, but remains offstage for the remainder of the play, having hardly anything to do after her marriage but to join in official processions and impress people with her beauty.

-- #X_0# --
Archbishop of #Y_0#, #X_0# spends the first acts of the play offstage, traveling to colleges to ask scholars about the legality of the king's divorce. As he travels, #X_2# spreads rumors about him and plots his demise. The king discovers this and gives #X_0# the king's own ring, so that he can appeal to the king in his trial. #X_0# is innocent of any wrongdoing and seems not to understand why others would have it in for him. When the king saves him from the #Y_1#, #X_0# forgives #X_2# for plotting against him. He baptizes the child #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
An emissary from the Pope, #X_0# has come to assess the situation of #X_1#'s divorce and give his decision about its legality. He carries papers from #Y_0# that apparently grant the divorce, since #X_1# plans to carry it out. He and #X_0# #X_3# speak to #X_2# to convince her to take part in the divorce proceedings, and they tell her that #X_1# still loves her and plans to protect her. She curses them both. Later, #X_0# flees to #Y_0# after #X_3#'s correspondence with the Pope urging against granting the divorce is discovered. It is not clear whether #X_0# supports or opposes the divorce or whether he was a pawn of the Pope or of #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
A lord of the court. At first, he does not believe #X_1#'s criticism of Cardinal #X_3# and urges #X_1# to hold his tongue. After #X_1#'s fall, #X_0# and other lords meet to scheme against #X_3#. When #X_3# falls into disgrace, #X_0# takes part in reading charges against #X_3#. After #X_3#'s demise, #X_0# is promoted. He takes part in a trial to bring down #X_2#, but the king saves #X_2#. #X_0# is in attendance at the baptism at the end of the play.

Although young and inexperienced, he realizes what damage may be reaped by such dissention among the lords. He marries a French earl's daughter, #X_2#, on the advice of #Y_2#, though she does not symbolize a politically advantageous match.

-- #X_0# --
The Dauphin of #Y_0#, #X_0# has himself crowned king and tries to recapture his kingdom from #X_1#. When he meets the warrior-woman #X_2#, he engages her in single combat but loses to her. He then wants her to become his lover but she refuses. #X_0# wins back half his former kingdom after a series of bloody battles, including one in which the English nobleman #X_3# dies. However, following this moderate gain, #X_0# desists in his campaign and agrees to make peace with the English, in order to spare his people from further slaughter.

-- #X_0# --
Named Protector of the English Realm, #X_0# manages the kingdom until Henry is old enough to rule. He and #X_1# disagree, and their serving men fight each other in street brawls. Yet #X_0# and #X_1# agree to stop fighting, temporarily, over the course of the play.

-- #X_0# --
Although his father once had claims to the throne, the young #X_0#lost all noble titles when his father was put to death. #X_0# disagrees with #X_4# about a point of law, and they each pick a different color rose as emblems of their opposing viewpoints, #X_0# choosing the white rose, #X_4# the red.

Called #X_0# VI, #X_0# is the king of England. Crowned at a young age when his popular warrior father died, #X_0# had a protector, Gloucester, to take care of the kingdom until he was old enough to rule. Prophecies at the time of #X_0#'s coronation declared that #X_0# VI would lose all the land in #Y_0# that his father #X_0# V won. 1 #X_0# VI depicts wars in #Y_0# to save those lands, but in this play #Y_0# is finally lost. #X_0# marries #X_3#, a French girl with no money, giving the French two regions in return for her hand; this horrifies #X_0#'s nobles, who see #Y_0# slipping out of their grasp. #X_0#'s overall weakness allows his nobles and his wife to create complex plots against each other and against him, culminating in a full-fledged civil war with #Y_1#. Throughout the play #X_0# is unable to assert his power.

-- #X_0# --
Named the protector of #Y_0# until #X_2# is old enough to rule, #X_0# has long-standing tension with #X_1#. #X_3# dislikes #X_0# because she believes he holds too much power over the throne. The other nobles believe #X_0# desires to seize the crown. However, #X_0# seems to be a genuinely noble man; he sticks up for the common people, and he believes his honorable behavior should speak for itself. Yet plots against him are too large, and #X_0# is murdered in his bed through the scheming of #Y_1#, #X_4#, #X_1#, and #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# believes he is heir to the throne of #Y_0#, and this motivates his every action. Throughout this play and 1 #X_4# VI, he tries to stay calm and wait until #X_4# is weaker and can be more easily ousted, but his patience runs thin. Already involved in disputes against #X_11#, #X_0# allies with #X_12# and #X_10# against the other lords of the court. He explains to these two men that he is heir to the third son of #X_2#, and #X_4# is heir to #X_2#'s fourth son. #X_9# was wrongfully removed from the throne by #X_4# IV, meaning the #X_8# line, including #X_4# VI, held the throne illegally. #X_0# intends to correct that, and he is delighted to be sent to #Y_1# to put down rebellions, for that means he is given an army. When he leaves, he hires Jack #X_1# to stir up trouble by pretending to be a #X_0# claimant to the throne, intending to return should #X_1#'s campaign prove popular.

In exchange for #X_0#, the French keep two pivotal regions of French territory, which upsets #Y_0#. #X_0# had imagined that #X_1# would be just like chivalrous #X_2#, so she is disappointed in the weak king.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a landholding noble, who, unique among nobles, prefers to stay on his property rather than come to #Y_0# and deal in the intrigues of the court. Seemingly kinder than the other nobles, #X_0# has no desire to fight with Jack #X_1#, who appears in his garden and insults him; but he is forced to fight and kills the starving #X_1#. #X_0#'s loyalties are always clear; he takes #X_1#'s head immediately to the king.

-- #X_0# --
York's son, brought in to testify on behalf of his father after York marches his army back from #Y_0#. #X_0# will become #X_0# III, subject for #X_3#'s play of the same name, and one of the most bloodthirsty and depraved kings in English history.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#, the Duke of #X_0#, believes that he is the true king of #Y_0#. Since King #X_1#'s grandfather seized the throne illegally from #X_3# II, then the real legal heir should have been the offspring of the younger brothers of #X_3# II. #X_3# is descended from #X_3# II's eldest brother, whereas #X_1# VI is descended from #X_3# II's younger brother. With this claim, #X_0# has brought dissention to the court, arguing with other nobles in 1 #X_1# VI and staking his claim in 2 #X_1# VI. He agrees to let #X_1# rule during his lifetime and receive the crown on #X_1#'s death, but #X_0#'s son urges him to seize the crown sooner. #X_0# dies in battle in the first act.

-- #X_0# --
King of #Y_0# at the beginning of the play, #X_0# is not a strong king; his nobles and his wife, #X_2#, take advantage of him. Unable to live up to the legacy of his legendary father, #X_0# V, #X_0# loses all the English territories in #Y_1# and cannot seem to control his warring nobles. In this play, he is twice thrust from the throne and twice imprisoned and once returned to place at the head of state. He flees battles and flees to #Y_2# but is always captured and brought back. Finally, he wishes to become a private citizen, desiring to be king in name only while other men rule. But in the end he is killed in prison by #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#'s eldest son, #X_0# inherits #X_4#'s struggle for the throne, and seizes it soon after his father is killed in battle. But the new power soon blinds him to the need to listen to his advisors and brothers, and he marries Lady #X_1#, thus, alienating #X_3# and the king of #Y_0#, who had negotiated for a wedding to the French king's sister. #X_0# falls from the throne and is imprisoned but freed by #X_2# and again becomes king at the end of the play.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
A younger brother of #X_1# and #X_2#, #X_0# is a fierce supporter of the #X_5#' claim to the throne. Most noted for his physical deformities, including a hump back, lame leg, and shriveled arm, #X_0# takes his physical deformity as proof that he will not succeed with women or in the world of the court. Therefore, he decides that the only thing for him is to gain the throne. Yet there are many ahead of him in line to the crown, who he must eliminate along the way, performing the role of a good brother and subject while secretly behaving with bloodthirsty abandon. Killing #X_3#, #X_0# declares himself severed from a world of family and brotherhood; he stands alone in his quest for the crown. One of the most compelling characters in #X_4#'s oeuvre, #X_0# has greater command of language than most other characters, and he has the best speeches. #X_0#'s deformities raise many questions; does he use his deformity as an excuse for his behavior, or is his body an outward manifestation of his ambition and his evil nature?

-- #X_0# --
Long one of #X_5#'s allies, #X_0# was a pivotal force in bringing #X_2# to the throne. Later, he is sent to #Y_0# to negotiate for marriage between #X_2# and Lady #X_1#, sister of the king of #Y_0#. When #X_2# marries someone else, #X_0# feels slighted and switches his allegiance to #X_3#, joining #X_4#'s army. Eventually, he is killed in battle with #X_2#'s forces.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s French wife, #X_0# was wooed in I #X_2# VI by #X_3#, who later became her lover. Alarmed that her husband is such a weak man, #X_0# begins taking over for him. She scolds him for having given in to #X_4#'s pressure in agreeing to pass the throne to #X_4# after his death. Then, she raises an army to fight with #X_4#; later, she stabs #X_4# to death. When #X_1# comes to the throne, #X_0# goes to #Y_0# to ask for aid and returns to lead more battles. #X_0# is cursed repeatedly by her enemies for being an unnatural woman, in having taken on such a masculine role to lead #X_2#'s armies. Yet she is the strongest inspirational force among all #X_2#'s supporters.

One of the three young women the men meet when they first arrive in #Y_0#. #X_0# and #X_1# are drawn to one another and later marry. #X_0# is mild-mannered and kind, but she is puzzled by #X_1#’s courtly insistence on treating her as if she were weaker than she actually is.

-- #X_0# --
One of the three young women the men meet when they first arrive in #Y_0#. #X_0# is the most intellectually curious of the group. The relationship between #X_0# and #X_4# is the most successful of the three couples, as it is based on a close friendship and mutual respect. #X_0# takes a great interest in the world beyond #Y_0#, convinced that there must be good in the world of men, despite the testimony of #X_4# and #X_2#. When #X_4# and #X_3# are forced to return home, #X_0# agrees to accompany them, motivated by love of #X_4#, curiosity about the world, and a desire to act as #Y_0#’s representative.

One of the three explorers who discover #X_2#, and the novel’s narrator. A sociologist by training, #X_3# is the “philosopher” of the group—the one who understands #X_2# most fully and critically—and the one who is most convinced that #X_2# has much to teach the outside world. #X_3# has some difficulty adjusting to a society in which women are simply “people” and not a protected and constrained “weaker sex,” but once he makes the shift, #X_3# sees the revolutionary implications of such a change more deeply than do his friends.

-- #X_0# --
One of the three explorers who discovers #Y_0#. A doctor and a botanist, #X_0# is also a southern gentleman, with refined, romantic notions of idealized femininity, notions that are strongly challenged by the athletic, independent women of #Y_0#. #X_0# falls in love with #X_1# and puzzles her with his insistence that he take care of her, rather than simply treat her as an equal partner. #X_0# soon comes to prefer #Y_0# to any country on Earth, though his appreciation of #Y_0#ian culture is tinged with his generally unrealistic, idealized vision of womanhood.

-- #X_0# --
One of the three explorers who discovers #Y_0#. #X_0# is the driving force behind the expedition to #Y_0# and the most forceful of the three friends. A classic male chauvinist, #X_0# fancies himself quite the ladies’ man and prides himself on his knowledge of and control over the female mind. Convinced that women like to be “mastered” both emotionally and physically by men, #X_0# is completely flummoxed by the women of #Y_0#, who don’t need men at all. #X_0# is unable to relate to women as equals, and this inability dooms his relationship with #X_1#.

One of the older women who tutors the three men in the ways of #X_1#. #X_0# is charged with guiding #X_2#, a difficult task she approaches with a great deal of patience. #X_2# is convinced that he has #X_0# outsmarted, but #X_3# sees that #X_0# is humoring #X_2# as she would a small child, concealing her amusement at his conceited ways.

#X_1#' father, he was a Russian-Jewish immigrant who moved his family to #Y_0# and raised his four children in the slums of #Y_1# on #Y_2#. He worked long hours to support the five members of his family, but often failed in his endeavors. He ended up working as a bootlegger, and had trouble succeeding at that, too. He had a temper, and made empty threats. Once, he threatened #X_1# with a gun.

He always has another purpose or plan in mind, but he rarely reveals his private thoughts.

-- #X_0# --
A dwarf who leads his fellow dwarves on a trip to the Lonely Mountain to reclaim their treasure from #X_2#. #X_2#’s bounty is #X_0#’s inheritance, as it belonged to #X_3#, #X_0#’s grandfather, the great King under the Mountain. #X_0# is a proud, purposeful, and sturdy warrior, if a bit stubborn at times. As the novel progresses, his inability to formulate successful plans, his greed, and his reliance on #X_1# to save him at every turn make #X_0# a somewhat unappealing figure, but he is partly redeemed by the remorse he shows before he dies.

-- #X_0# --
A strange, small, slimy creature who lives deep in the caves of Moria beneath the Misty Mountains. There, #X_0# broods over his “precious,” a magic ring, until he accidentally loses it and #X_1# finds it. We never learn exactly what kind of creature he is. Apparently, his true shape has been too deformed by years of living in darkness to be recognizable.

-- #X_0# --
The great dragon who lives in the Lonely Mountain. Years ago, #X_0# heard of the treasure that the dwarves had amassed in the mountain under #X_1#’s reign, and he drove them away to claim the gold for himself.

-- #X_0# --
The grim human who is the honorable captain of the guard in Lake Town, a human city built on Long Lake just south of the Lonely Mountain. With the help of information discovered by #X_1# and related by a thrush, #X_0# finds #X_2#’s weak spot and kills him.

-- #X_0# --
An evil sorcerer and creator of the magic ring. Also called the Necromancer, #X_0# is only mentioned in The Hobbit; he never actually appears.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s grandfather. #X_0# mined Moria, a series of caves under the Mountain, and discovered a wealth of gold and jewels. He became King under the Mountain, but before long, the dragon Smaug came and killed or scattered all of #X_0#’s people.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s group, composed of Fili, Kili, Dwalin, Balin, Oin, Gloin, Ori, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur, none of whom is really developed as an individual character in the novel. The narrator describes dwarves unfavorably in Chapter 12, noting their greed and trickery. Some, however, are “decent enough people like #X_1# and Company, if you don’t expect too much.”

-- #X_0# --
The first creatures in Middle-Earth.  Immortal unless killed in battle, they are fair-faced, with beautiful voices, and have a close communion with nature, which makes them wonderful craftsmen. There are actually two different varieties of elves: the wood elves and the high elves. The wood elves reside in #Y_0# and, as a result, have more suspicious and less wise tendencies than their high relatives.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# appear in the settlement of Lake Town near the Lonely Mountain. #X_1# emphasizes their mortality, their lack of wisdom, their discordance with nature, and their rampant feuding, but he does not describe humans as inherently evil in the same way that he characterizes goblins and Wargs.

-- #X_0# --
Short-tempered and dull-witted creatures who will eat just about anything, the trolls are based on mythological creatures taken from Old English and Anglo-Saxon poems and on figures from popular fairy tales and folklore. #X_1# has them speak with a cockney accent, the dialect of lower-class Londoners, which injects a modern joke into the fantasy epic.

-- ##X_3#_0# --
##X_3#_0# is the leader of the group of boys at #Y_0#. Although he is small and cannot see well, he manages to take charge and have the other boys follow his orders. He is nice to ##X_3#_2# when ##X_3#_2# gives him the gold tube that he finds in the dirt.

-- #X_0# --

She has hidden cameras that she uses to spy on the boys and nail polish with rattlesnake venom that she will use to scratch those who displease her. She is a descendent of #X_1# and #X_3# and is making the boys dig holes in an attempt to dig up #X_2# treasure.

-- #X_0# --

It is #X_0# who leads the citizens of #Y_0# to burn down the schoolhouse and kill #X_3# after he kisses #X_1#. #X_0# also has a very bad foot odor caused by a fungus. For this reason people call him Trout, because his feet smell like dead fish.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The novel's protagonist. #X_0# is a thirteen-year-old girl with a haircut that makes her look like a boy and a fierce determination to survive and keep her family together. #X_0#, as the oldest child of a mentally unwell single mother, is used to playing the role of an adult in her family, but when their mother abandons them in a parking lot in #Y_0#, #X_0# steps into greater responsibility than she ever had. #X_0# is tough, pragmatic, and suspicious of anyone outside of the circle formed by her immediate family, only taking help from others when she absolutely needs to do so. She is willing to do everything within her power and take any risks necessary to protect her siblings and keep them together.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s twelve-year-old brother. #X_0# is serious and intelligent, and unlike #X_2#, cannot fight to defend himself when his peers tease him about his family. Consequently, #X_0# withdraws into his studies and philosophical musings. He reacts to #X_3#'s departure more harshly and judgmentally than #X_2#, and occasionally indulges in criticism of her lifestyle to help explain why she left them. He looks up to #X_2# and relies on her to make decisions, but can also act rebelliously and selfishly.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s eight-year-old sister. #X_0# is a quiet and pretty young girl troubled by an overwhelming shyness. Her shyness and difficulty performing in front of others have resulted in her being held back in school and in the perception of her peers and teachers that she is mentally retarded. The #X_0#s know differently. #X_0# is uncannily emotionally perceptive and can quickly and easily sense the emotional truth behind people and the implications of the situations in which they find themselves. #X_0# takes after #X_2# physically, and can sing beautifully.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s six-year-old brother. #X_0# is a stubborn and uninhibited child. #X_5#'s favorite, and as the youngest, he is perhaps hardest hit by #X_5#'s disappearance. Like #X_2#, #X_0# has learned how to fight to ward off the taunts of his peers, which are even worse for him than for #X_2# because the children tease him about #X_4# as well as about #X_5#. Thus, #X_0# is belligerent, aggressive, and stubborn, but often, especially with his family, he is joyful, spontaneous, and utterly free. This recklessly happy side of #X_0# is part of what wins #X_3# over in the end of the book.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_4# children's grandmother and #X_2#'s mother. #X_0#lives by herself on a run-down farm outside of #Y_0#, #Y_1#. #X_0#shares #X_3#'s belligerence and stubbornness and #X_1#'s determination. #X_0#has been hardened by a long marriage to a stern and unloving man, now four years dead, and her stubborn conviction to stand by him and his decisions, even when she disagreed with him. Her unhappy marriage has made her angry and bitter, and caused her to become estranged from all her three children.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_3#'s mother. #X_0#decided when she left home at the age of twenty never to marry, having learned from #X_1#'s sad example. #X_0#is loving and beautiful, but is neither reliable nor practical. When #X_0#is pregnant with #X_2#, their fourth child, the childrens' father leaves her, possibly under legal duress. #X_0#struggles under the responsibility of raising her four children on her own, but eventually buckles under the pressure.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_2# children's cousin. #X_0#is #X_1#'s sister's daughter. #X_0#is a pious Catholic used to her routine and very nearly incapable of spontaneity and affection. She takes the #X_2# children in out of a sense of duty, but, consciously or not, expects the children to show gratitude and earn their keep through their good behavior and hard work. Fussy and flighty, #X_0#lives a carefully scripted life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s priest. #X_0# is a well-intentioned but ultimately unsympathetic man. #X_1# relies on him for advice when the #X_2# children appear on his doorstep. Though, from his perspective, he has the good of the children firmly in mind, he never truly tries to understand them or reach out to them. Like #X_1#, he is guided by a sense of piety, religious duty, and propriety.

-- #X_0# --
One of a pair of runaways the #X_2# children meet in a state park in #Y_0# during the first half of their journey. #X_0# is selfish and immoral, rationalizing theft and irresponsibility as a way of rebelling against an unjust system.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s girlfriend. #X_0# buys into #X_1#'s cynical and self-indulgent philosophies about life and right and wrong. #X_1# convinced her to steal money from her father and run away with him, and occasionally he teases her and treats her cruelly. #X_0# is a gentle girl and plays the autoharp, so the children warily agree to spending time with the couple.

-- #X_0# --
A garrulous and friendly #Y_1# undergraduate who takes the #X_2# in one rainy night in #Y_0#. #X_0# explains his generosity by telling the children of his own experiences as a young runaway. #X_0# is non-judgmental, spontaneous, and fun.

-- #X_0# --
Windy's roommate. #X_0# is quieter and more serious than Windy, but just as generous and open-hearted. He talks gravely to #X_1# about the personal implications of stealing, and plays the Dobro, teaching the children a song they take with them all the way to #Y_1#. #X_0# drives the children to #Y_0# in his car.

-- #X_0# --
One of the two boys who takes the #X_3# across the Chesapeake Bay on a sailboat. #X_0# is a little overweight and enjoys daring his friend, #X_2#, to take risks.

-- #X_0# --
The novel's protagonist. #X_0# is the famed #Y_0# detective with a keen eye, hawked nose, and the trademark hat and pipe. #X_0# is observation and intuition personified, and though he takes a bit of a back seat to #X_2# in this story, we always feel his presence. It takes his legendary powers to decipher the mystifying threads of the case.

-- #X_0# --
The novel's other protagonist and narrator. #X_0# is the stout sidekick to #X_1# and longtime chronicler of the detective's adventures. In Hound, #X_0# tries his hand at #X_1#' game, expressing his eagerness to please and impress the master by solving such a baffling case. As sidekick and apprentice to #X_1#, #X_0# acts as a foil for #X_1#' genius and as a stand-in for us, the awestruck audience.

-- #X_0# --
The late #X_0# #X_1#'s nephew and closet living relative. #X_0# #X_0# is hale and hearty, described as "a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very sturdily built." By the end of the story, #X_0# is as worn out and shell-shocked as his late uncle was before his death.

-- #X_0# --
The head of the #X_0# estate. #X_0# #X_0# was a superstitious man, and terrified of the #X_0# curse and his waning health at the time of his death. #X_0# #X_0# was also a well-known philanthropist, and his plans to invest in the regions surrounding his estate make it essential that #X_0# #X_2# move to #X_0# Hall to continue his uncle's good works.

-- #X_0# --
A debaucherous and shadowy #X_0# ancestor, #X_0# #X_0# is the picture of aristocratic excess, drinking and pursuing pleasures of the flesh until it killed him.

Family friend and doctor to the #X_2#. #X_0#is a tall, thin man who dresses sloppily but is an all-around nice guy and the executor of #X_3#'s estate. #X_0#is also a phrenology enthusiast, and he wishes and hopes to some day have the opportunity to study #X_4#' head.

-- #X_0# --
A thin and bookish-looking entomologist and one-time schoolmaster, #X_0# chases butterflies and reveals his short temper only at key moments. A calm façade masks the scheming, manipulative villain that #X_1# and #X_2# come to respect and fear.

-- #X_0# --
Allegedly #X_0#'s sister, this dusky Latin beauty turns out to be his wife. Eager to prevent another death but terrified of her husband, she provides enigmatic warnings to Sir #X_1# and #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The longtime domestic help of the #X_2# clan. Earnest and eager to please, the portly #X_0# #X_0# and her gaunt husband figure as a kind of red herring for the detectives, in league with their convict brother but ultimately no more suspicious than Sir #X_4#.

-- #X_0# --
A local young woman. #X_0#is the beautiful brunette daughter of "#X_2# the crank," the local litigator who disowned her when she married against his will. Subsequently abandoned by her husband, the credulous #X_0# turns to Mr. #X_4# and #X_1# for help.

-- #X_0# --
A murderous villain, whose crimes defy description. #X_0# is nonetheless humanized by his association with the #X_1#. He has a rodent-like, haggardly appearance. His only wish is to flee his persecutors in #Y_0# and escape to South America.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s father. #X_0# is a man who likes to sue, a sort of comic relief with a chip on his shoulder about every infringement on what he sees as his rights. Villainized due to his one-time harsh treatment of #X_2#, #X_0# is for the most part a laughable jester in the context of this story.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The cook in the #X_1# household. #X_0#is relentlessly domestic and stands in contrast to #Y_0#’s distracted relationship with the house and its workings. Her practicality prevents her from understanding #Y_0#’s dedication to her writing. She resents #Y_0#’s lack of involvement in her own house.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s sister, a respected painter. #X_0# has a raucous, colorful, cheerful life and is mother to three children.

A troublemaking teen. #X_0# lives in the town of #Y_0# who, with his two friends, harasses #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
Gives #X_1# a map at the outset of his journey. He is paranoid about identity crimes and lack of privacy.

-- #X_0# --
Find #X_1# unconscious in a ditch. #X_2# and #X_3# give #X_1# a ride to #X_4#. #X_2# is concerned about #X_1#'s health, but #X_3# is paranoid and afraid of strangers.

-- #X_0# --
Steals #X_1#'s bike. #X_0# is immature and a known town thief. He is member of the large #X_0# family, and has some kind of conflict with his mother.

-- #X_0# --
Mysterious and male. Each time #X_1# tries to call #X_2#, he always seems to connect through the same operator.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# real name and #X_1#'s #X_3#'s father. #X_0# was a political reporter in the town of #Y_0#, #Y_1#, and testified against a powerful organization. After several murder attempts, he was forced to change identities and relocate with his family.

-- #X_0# --
A mysterious figure that pretends to assist the #X_4#. #X_0# is the head of a new government department called #Y_0#. This program assigns the #X_3# family a new identity. #X_0# is a secretive figure who blends into the background, and he has uncertain intentions. #X_0# checks up on the family a few times each month, but #X_1#'s father believes it is to see if #X_2# is withholding any important information.

-- #X_0# --
A kindly doctor. #X_0# oversees the mental hospital #X_1#, where he is a patient.

-- #X_0# --
A salesman. Immediately likable, #X_2# speaks like a salesman with an "easy flow of glib, persuasive convincingness." His shrewd eyes can take in anyone at a glance, thus his immediate intuition that he and #X_3# have something in common. #X_2# is the saloon's anxiously-awaited guest, his arrival promising free drinks and merriment. However, this time the group's "messiah," so to speak, comes bearing a different gospel of salvation, urging them to divest themselves of their pipe dreams and finally make peace with themselves. #X_2#'s murder of the tomorrow dreams will bring ruin the bar, thus #X_2# is the "Iceman," or #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The play's "Foolosopher." #X_0# is a tall, raw-boned Irishman in his sixties who was once a Syndicalist-Anarchist. Having bitterly retired from the world, he presents himself as a man who has chosen to watch the carnage from the grandstand of philosophical detachment and eagerly awaits his death. #X_1# notes that #X_0# has a "mystic's meditative pale-blue eyes with a gleam of sharp sardonic humor in them" and his look of "tired tolerance" gives his face the quality of a weary priest.

-- #X_0# --
A gangly, awkward eighteen-year-old who has come to #X_2# upon a crackdown on the Anarchist movement made possible by his treason. #X_2# was once his Anarchist mother's lover. Wracked by guilt over his betrayal of his mother, he will beg for #X_2#'s judgment throughout the play and progressively come to acknowledge the hate that underpinned his treason. In this sense, he serves as #X_1#'s double.

-- #X_0# --
The owner of the saloon. #X_0# is a "bag of bones" in his sixties with the face of an old, balky family horse. He wears spectacles so misaligned that at times one eye peers over one lens while another looks half under the other glass. Likable to all, he hides his vulnerability behind a "testy truculent manner" but fools no one. #X_0# has not ventured outside the bar in twenty years and his pipe dream is that he has remained inside out of respect for his dead wife #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The night bartender. #X_0# is a Neopolitan-American in his late twenties, squat and muscular with a swarthy face and beady eyes. He is tough, sentimental, and good-natured. His pipe dream involves his refusal to admit to himself that he is a pimp.

-- #X_0# --
A former Anarchist editor who served ten years in prison for his activities. #X_0# is a small, fastidiously clean man with an over-sized head, a "walrus mustache" and black eyes that peer from behind thick spectacles. A "foreign atmosphere" pervades him, #X_0# bearing the "stamp of an alien radical, a strong resemblance to the type Anarchist as portrayed, bomb in hand, in newspaper cartoons." His pipe dream of political liberation allows him to deny his desire to rule over the masses. He is drunk for the entire play, intermittently rousing from his stupor to denounce the crowd, whine for a drink, and make odes to #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A born grafter, con man, and practical joker. #X_0# is a fat, bald in his late fifties with an unshaven kewpie's face. His erstwhile circus career manifests itself in his flashy worn clothes. His pipe dream consists of his return to the circus.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s drinking partner. The fiftyish #X_0# has the look of his former police days stamped all over him. His once brutal and greedy face has melted into a "good-humored, parasite's characterlessness." He dreams of disproving his conviction on graft charges and returning to the police force.

-- #X_0# --
A man in his thirties who left #Y_0# upon the ruin of his prominent industrialist father. #X_0# dreams of starting his legal career and he speaks with "mocking suavity." Dressed in paper-thin rags, he shudders continually in his drunken stupor, his eyelids fluttering "as if any light were too strong for his eyes."

-- #X_0# --
A black man in his fifties who dreams of re-opening his colored gambling house. He wears a once-flashy suit and sports a scar across his left cheek. #X_1# notes that his "face is only mildly Negroid in type" and #X_0#'s pipe dream involves a degree of passing as white.

-- #X_0# --
A huge Boer in his fifties whose once strapping frame has drowned in a blubbering mass of "flaccid tallow." He is #X_1#'s drinking partner and dreams of returning to #Y_0#, having left in disgrace for his cowardice during the Boer war. He is distinguished by his comic accent.

-- #X_0# --
A veteran from the Boer War, Captain #X_0# is as "obviously English as Yorkshire pudding." He is in his late fifties, of a lean and erect figure, and sports a war wound on his left shoulder. He dreams of returning to #Y_0#, having been driven out upon losing his regiment's money in a drunken night of gambling.

-- #X_0# --
Has the face of an "old, well-bred, gentle housedog" with guileless and bloodshot eyes. He has the manners of a gentleman, mixing the qualities of a "prim, Victorian old mad" and a boy who has never grown up. He dreams of returning to his newspaper career. As his name suggests, he is the leader of the so-called "Tomorrow Movement," endlessly deferring the realization of the pipe dream to the day after.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s two "tarts" are feather-brained, sentimental, lazy, and reasonably content with life. Though they retain a degree of youthful prettiness, their trade is beginning to wear on them. Their pipe dream involves the denial of their status as whores. They relate to their pipe as two affectionate sisters might with a bullying brother.

-- #X_0# --
A thick-necked, barrel-chested, swarthy, and amiable Italian American who serves as the day bartender. He shares a pipe dream with his lover and whore #X_1# about getting married and buying a farm in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A thin, peroxide blonde a few years older than #X_2#'s tarts whose doll-like prettiness has begun to decline.

-- #X_0# --
The two, ordinary-looking policemen who arrest #X_1#. #X_0# is middle-aged and #X_0# in his twenties.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0# is the play's "tragic" hero, a government official who owes his success and fortune to secret scandal. As the stage notes indicate, #X_0# #X_0# is a "personality of mark" with a manner of impeccable distinction; the contrast between his chiseled jaw and romantic eyes suggests a violently willed separation of thought and emotion in his personality. #X_0# #X_0# suffers from certain divided loyalties as well. Extremely ambitious, #X_0# #X_0# remains tied, even at present, to his mentor Baron #X_1#' s gospels of wealth and power, gospels that emphasize the domination of others over all else. On the other hand, love has driven him to hide his past in the desperate hope of remaining the ideal husband to his wife. Conscious of what his success has c ost him, #X_0# #X_0# suffers from a decidedly nervous and harried temperament.

-- #X_0# --
A woman of grave Greek beauty and twenty-seven years of age, #X_0# #X_0# embodies the Victorian new woman: upright, virtuous, educated, politically engaged, and active in her husband's career. She is the play's sentimental heroine, a sort of moral absol utist who worships her ideal husband and cannot brook the revelation of his secret past. In terms of #X_1#'s other plays, #X_0# #X_0# recalls the puritanical #X_0# #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
One of the play's wittiest and most well dressed characters, #X_0# is the vicious and opportunistic villainness, a disciple of the deceased Baron #X_1# who values wealth and power above all. She stands as foil to the virtuous and earnest Lady #X_2# #X_4#, being cast throughout the play as a sort of monstrous femme fatale. Notably, #X_0# is continuously imagined as the product of "horrid combinations" that evoke her duplicity. To take a few examples of how the play constructs her dou ble-dealing: one character in Act I describes her as the "unnatural" union of daytime genius and nighttime beauty. More viciously, Act III describes her as lamia-like—that is, reminiscent of a female demon, half woman and half snake. One could perha ps draw parallels between #X_0# and the adventuresome #X_0# #X_3# from Lady Windermere's Fan.

-- #X_0# --
Of impeccable dress and inimitable wit, #X_0# is the play's thirty-something dandified philosopher, an idle aristocrat who serves as a thinly veiled double for #X_5# himself. Irreverent, wry, and dangerously clever, #X_0# "plays with the world" and in doing so rejects ideals of duty, respectability, and responsibility. As with #X_5#'s other dandies, he functions as a figure for modern art of living and the aestheticist creed, particularly in his encounters with his stuffy father, #X_0# #X_1# . Expounding a philosophy of love and forgiveness, #X_0# also figures as savior and helpmate to the #X_2#s, teaching Lady #X_2# in particular of the dangers in idealizing one's husband. In terms of #X_5#'s other plays, #X_0# recalls the dandified #X_0# #X_4# in A Woman of No Importance.

-- #X_0# --
An exemplar of English prettiness, #X_0#, Sir #X_3#'s younger sister, embodies what #X_4# describes as the "fascinating tyranny of youth" and "astonishing courage of innocence." Pert and clever, #X_0# flirtatiously matches Lord #X_2#'s wit throughout t he play and their somewhat unconventional union serves as a foil to the other marriages and would-be engagements that compose the plot. #X_0# acts much like #X_1# in The Importance of Being Earnest.

-- #X_0# --
Father to #X_0# #X_1#, #X_0#, described as a "fine Whig type," is a stuffy, serious, and respectable gentleman who is firmly opposed to the excesses of his dandified son. Continually he urges his son to marry and adopt a career, posing Sir #X_2# as model. #X_0# appears as a figure for the old-fashioned against a son who makes and masters the art of modern living.

-- #X_0# --
A pleasant and popular woman with "gray hair à la marquise and good lace," #X_0# appears at the dinner party in Act I and visits #X_0# #X_2# in II, both times with Mrs. #X_1# in arm. #X_0# is emblematic of an older generation of So ciety women, bemoaning the effect of politics and the higher education of women on married life. In this sense, she counterpoises the Victorian new woman embodied by #X_0# #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#are described as "types of exquisite fragility" with an affection of manner of delicate charm, ideal subjects for the French Rococo painter #X_1#. Never developed into major characters, these women frivolously banter on a number of topics throughout Act I; notable ones include the dreariness of politics, being serious, education, and so on. Like #X_1#'s figures, they are perhaps more decorative than anything else, though—as the insightfulness of their conversatio ns suggests—one can never underestimate the decorative on #X_2#'s stage.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, attaché at #Y_1# in #Y_0#, is a young man famous for his ties and Anglomania. He appears in Act I at Sir #X_1#'s dinner party as a sort of comic figure, his malapropisms and awkward speech posed against the polishe d repartee of the other guests.

-- #X_0# --
A "perfectly groomed" young dandy and secretary to Sir #X_2#. He appears briefly in Act I and escorts Mrs. #X_1# to dinner.

-- #X_0# --
A "mask with a manner" who serves Lord #X_1#. #X_0#is the ideal butler. Absolutely impassive, he reveals nothing of his intellect or emotions and "represents the dominance of form." #X_0#appears briefly at the beginning of Act IV in a comic interlud e with Lord #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A minor character, #X_0# is Lord #X_2#'s footman and appears to show Mrs. #X_1# into Lord #X_2#'s library in Act III and withdraws when #X_3# gives him a glassy stare.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# to Sir #X_2#, #X_0# is another minor character who announces each guest at the dinner party in Act I.

-- #X_0# --
Sir #X_2#'s footman. He appears briefly in Act IV.

He comes to #Y_0# after an absence of four years spent in a sanitarium in #Y_1#. #X_0# is innocent, naïve, impractical, compassionate, and immensely kind, which leads most characters in the novel to consider him an "idiot."

-- #X_0# --
An immensely beautiful femme-fatale in her mid-twenties whom many of the characters call "mad." #X_3# #X_0# was once a ward of #X_6#. Later, however, he seduced her and made her his mistress when she was a young woman.

A dark-haired, dark-eyed twenty-seven year-old who is descended from a long line of merchants. #X_0# is madly and passionately in love with #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
A thin, fair-haired, good-looking young man of twenty-eight. #X_3# is highly vain and ambitious. Although the epitome of mediocrity, he strives for originality. He is in love with #X_2#, but is willing to marry #X_4#—whom he despises—for 75,000 rubles.

The middle daughter of the #X_0#s, who is twenty-three. #X_0#, like her older sister, is very cultivated and expresses a talent for painting. She is engaged to Prince S.

-- #X_0# --
A seventeen year-old consumptive. #X_0# is well aware of his approaching death and feels like an outcast of nature. He tries to reassert himself by espousing his own views on life and morality in his "Essential Statement" and then by his suicide attempt, which proves unsuccessful. In love with #X_1#, #X_0# is a friend of #X_3# and the son of Madame #X_0#, the mistress of General #X_2#.

General #X_0#'s wife. #X_0# #X_0#, a dignified woman of about fifty, is the mother of #X_6#, #X_2#, and Kolya #X_0#. Despite her husband's lying and keeping of a mistress, she pities him and even helps #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s dignified twenty-three-year-old sister. #X_5# is among the characters whom the narrator considers ordinary people. She tries to help her brother's chances with #X_2# by befriending the #X_6# girls, but to no avail.

-- #X_0# --
An ugly and insolent lodger in the #X_1# apartment at the beginning of the novel. #X_0# strives to be original, yet most people regard him contemptuously as a drunkard and an amoral rogue.

-- #X_0# --
A young man who fraudulently claims to be the son of #X_2#, #X_1#'s late benefactor. #X_0# attempts to use the false claim to gain access to a portion of the prince's inheritance.

-- #X_0# --
(#X_2#) #X_0#—named #X_2# at birth—writes about her experiences growing up as a black girl in the rural South and in the cities of #Y_2#, #Y_0#, and #Y_1#. #X_0# has an unusual degree of curiosity and perceptiveness. Haunted by her displacement from her biological parents and her sense that she is ugly, #X_0# often isolates herself, escaping into her reading. #X_0#’s autobiography traces the start of her development into an independent, wise, and compassionate woman.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s older brother. Like #X_2#, he is intelligent and mature beyond his age. Though #X_0# enjoys sports and fares well in social situations, he also shows deep compassion for his isolated sister. #X_0# senses the negative influences of racism, but to protect himself from despair, he chooses to anesthetize himself and subdue his soul until the negative moment passes.

-- #X_0# --
(Momma) #X_2# and #X_1#’s paternal grandmother. Momma raises them for most of their childhood. She owns the only store in the black section of #Y_1#, #Y_0#, and it serves as the central gathering place for the black community. She raises the children according to stern Christian values and strict rules. Though she never reacts with emotion, both children feel her love anyway.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# and #X_2#’s mother. Although she has a nursing degree, she earns most of her money working in gambling parlors or by gambling herself.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# and #X_0#’s father. Despite his lively personality, he is handsome, vain, and selfish. He stands out among the other rural blacks because of his proper English and his flashy possessions. #X_3# implies that #X_0# #X_0#’s pretensions result from his disenfranchisement as a black man in the United  States. #X_0# #X_0# does not respect, care for, or connect with #X_3#.

#X_1#’s son, who is in his thirties. Injured in a childhood accident, Uncle #X_0# lives his entire life with #X_1#. He suffers insults and jokes because of his disability. Like #X_1#, he is a devout Christian, and he acts as the children’s disciplinarian and protector.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s second husband, whom she marries after her children join her in #Y_0#. Although #X_1# initially tries to dismiss him, #X_0# becomes the only real “father” #X_1# knows. He combines the virtues of strength and tenderness and enjoys thinking of himself as #X_1#’s father. He introduces her to his con-men friends and teaches her how to play poker. A successful businessman despite his lack of education, he remains modest and confident.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s live-in boyfriend in #Y_0#. When #X_2# and #X_1# move to #Y_0#, #X_0# sexually molests and rapes #X_2#, taking advantage of her need for physical affection and her innocent, self-conscious nature. In retrospect, #X_2# feels partly responsible for #X_0#’s fate, and her guilt over his murder haunts her throughout her childhood.

-- #X_0# --
A black aristocrat living in #Y_1#, #Y_0#. One of #X_2#’s idols, she becomes the first person to prod #X_2# out of her silence after #X_2#’s rape, taking an interest in #X_2# and making her feel special. #X_2# respects #X_0# #X_0# mainly for encouraging her love of literature.

-- #X_0# --
A Southern white woman in #Y_0# and #X_3#’s first employer. Perhaps unwittingly, she hides her racism under a self-deceptive veneer of gentility. #X_0# #X_0#’s disrespect for #X_3#’s wish to be called by her given name leads to #X_3#’s subtly rebellious smashing of the #X_0#s’ china.

-- #X_0# --
(Formerly Hallelujah) Mrs. #X_1#’s cook. A descendent of the slaves once owned by the #X_1# family, her acceptance of Mrs. #X_1#’s condescending and racist renaming practices contrasts with #X_2#’s resistance.

-- #X_0# --
A white speaker at #X_1#’s eighth-grade graduation ceremony. He insults the black community by talking condescendingly, but not explicitly, of their limited potential in a racist society. His racist tone casts a pall over the graduation and infuriates #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The valedictorian of #X_2#’s eighth-grade graduating class. He leads the class in “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing,” popularly known as the Black National Anthem, and renews his community’s pride following Mr. #X_1#’s speech. This moment catalyzes #X_2#’s great pride in her heritage and also inspires her passion for black poets and orators.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# prim-and-proper live-in girlfriend in #Y_0#. #X_2# spends the summer with them when she is fifteen and drives #X_0# into a jealous rage. #X_2#’s decision to show compassion toward her shows #X_2#’s capacity for mercy, despite her self-aware and proud nature.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s first friend outside her family. When she is with #X_0#, #X_2# is able to escape her troubles and play like a child should.

-- #X_0# --
An eighth-grader who writes #X_1# a valentine. #X_1# reacts with hostility at first, distrusting any man’s advances after the rape. She softens when #X_0# writes her another letter showing that his interest in her is sincere.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s first love, with whom he loses his virginity. #X_0#’s relationship with #X_1# foreshadows the troubles associated with adolescent sexuality that #X_2# will experience in #Y_0#. Four years older than #X_1#, #X_0# turns his innocent displays of sexual curiosity playing “Momma and Papa” into sexual intercourse and eventually runs away with a railroad porter whom she meets at the store, leaving #X_1# heartbroken and morose.

-- #X_0# --
A white dentist in #X_4# to whom #X_3# lent money during the Great Depression. #X_3#’s staunch effort to appeal to his sense of ethics to support her in treating #X_2#’s tooth shows both her resolve and her ability to act somewhat unethically out of necessity. The scene also reinforces #X_2#’s impression of #X_3# as a superhero.

#X_0#, Spots, Just Black, Cool
Clyde, Tight Coat, and Red Leg Daddy --
#X_1#’s con-men friends, who teach #X_2# that it is possible to use white prejudice to gain advantage over whites. They represent creativity and the ethics that result from necessity and desperation.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# son of the military man Peleus and the sea-nymph #X_0#tis. #X_0# most powerful warrior in #X_0# Iliad, Achilles commands the Myrmidons, soldiers from his homeland of Phthia in Greece. Proud and headstrong, he takes offense easily and reacts with blistering indignation when he perceives that his honor has been slighted. Achilles’ wrath at Agamemnon for taking his war prize, the maiden Briseis, forms the main subject of #X_0# Iliad.

-- #X_0# --
The son of the military man Peleus and the sea-nymph Thetis. The most powerful warrior in The Iliad, #X_0# commands the Myrmidons, soldiers from his homeland of Phthia in Greece. Proud and headstrong, he takes offense easily and reacts with blistering indignation when he perceives that his honor has been slighted. #X_0#’ wrath at Agamemnon for taking his war prize, the maiden Briseis, forms the main subject of The Iliad.

-- #X_0# --
King of Mycenae and leader of the Achaean army; brother of King Menelaus of Sparta. Arrogant and often selfish, #X_0# provides the Achaeans with strong but sometimes reckless and self-serving leadership. Like #X_1#, he lacks consideration and forethought. Most saliently, his tactless appropriation of #X_1#’ war prize, the maiden Briseis, creates a crisis for the Achaeans, when #X_1#, insulted, withdraws from the war.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’ beloved friend, companion, and advisor, #X_0# grew up alongside the great warrior in Phthia, under the guardianship of Peleus. Devoted to both #X_1# and the Achaean cause, #X_0# stands by the enraged #X_1# but also dons #X_1#’ terrifying armor in an attempt to hold the Trojans back.

-- #X_0# --
A fine warrior and the cleverest of the Achaean commanders. Along with Nestor, #X_0# is one of the Achaeans’ two best public speakers. He helps mediate between Agamemnon and Achilles during their quarrel and often prevents them from making rash decisions.

-- #X_0# --
The youngest of the Achaean commanders, #X_0# is bold and sometimes proves impetuous. After Achilles withdraws from combat, #X_1# inspires #X_0# with such courage that he actually wounds two gods, Aphrodite and Ares.

-- #X_0# --
An Achaean commander, #X_0# (sometimes called “Telamonian #X_0#” or simply “#X_0#”) is the second mightiest Achaean warrior after Achilles. His extraordinary size and strength help him to wound #X_1# twice by hitting him with boulders. He often fights alongside Little #X_0#, and the pair is frequently referred to as the “Aeantes.”

-- #X_0# --
An Achaean commander, #X_0# is the son of Oileus (to be distinguished from Great #X_0#, the son of Telamon). He often fights alongside Great #X_0#, whose stature and strength complement #X_0#’s small size and swift speed. The two together are sometimes called the “Aeantes.”

-- #X_0# --
King of Pylos and the oldest Achaean commander. Although age has taken much of #X_0#’s physical strength, it has left him with great wisdom. He often acts as an advisor to the military commanders, especially Agamemnon. #X_0# and #X_2# are the Achaeans’ most deft and persuasive orators, although #X_0#’s speeches are sometimes long-winded.

-- #X_0# --
King of Sparta; the younger brother of Agamemnon. While it is the abduction of his wife, #X_1#, by the Trojan prince #Y_0# that sparks the Trojan War, #X_0# proves quieter, less imposing, and less arrogant than Agamemnon. Though he has a stout heart, #X_0# is not among the mightiest Achaean warriors.

-- #X_0# --
A son of King #X_6# and Queen #X_5#, #X_4# is the mightiest warrior in the Trojan army. He mirrors #X_1# in some of his flaws, but his bloodlust is not so great as that of #X_1#.

He fights effectively with a bow and arrow (never with the more manly sword or spear) but often lacks the spirit for battle and prefers to sit in his room making love to #X_3# while others fight for him, thus earning both #X_1#’s and #X_3#’s scorn.

-- #X_0# --
Reputed to be the most beautiful woman in the ancient world, #X_0# was stolen from her husband, #X_1#, and taken to #Y_1# by #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s husband and cousin, a poor steel worker. #X_3# and #X_2# grew up on the same tobacco farm with their grandfather, Tommy #X_0#.

The play’s protagonist. #X_6# Worthing is a seemingly responsible and respectable young man who leads a double life. In #Y_0#, where he has a country estate, #X_6# is known as #X_6#. In #Y_2# he is known as #X_4#. As a baby, #X_6# was discovered in a handbag in the cloakroom of #Y_3# by an old man who adopted him and subsequently made #X_6# guardian to his granddaughter, #X_3#. #X_6# is in love with his friend #X_2#’s cousin, #X_5#. The initials after his name indicate that he is a Justice of the Peace.

-- #X_0# --
The play’s secondary hero. #X_0# is a charming, idle, decorative bachelor, nephew of Lady #X_1#, cousin of #X_4#, and best friend of #X_5#, whom he has known for years as #X_3#. #X_0# is brilliant, witty, selfish, amoral, and given to making delightful paradoxical and epigrammatic pronouncements. He has invented a fictional friend, “#X_2#,” an invalid whose frequent sudden relapses allow #X_0# to wriggle out of unpleasant or dull social obligations.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s cousin and Lady #X_2#’s daughter. #X_0# is in love with #X_4#, whom she knows as #X_3#. A model and arbiter of high fashion and society, #X_0# speaks with unassailable authority on matters of taste and morality. She is sophisticated, intellectual, cosmopolitan, and utterly pretentious. #X_0# is fixated on the name #X_3# and says she will not marry a man without that name.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s ward, the granddaughter of the old gentlemen who found and adopted #X_3# when #X_3# was a baby. #X_0# is probably the most realistically drawn character in the play. Like #X_2#, she is obsessed with the name #X_1#, but she is even more intrigued by the idea of wickedness. This idea, rather than the virtuous-sounding name, has prompted her to fall in love with #X_3#’s brother #X_1# in her imagination and to invent an elaborate romance and courtship between them.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s snobbish, mercenary, and domineering aunt and #X_2#’s mother. #X_0# married well, and her primary goal in life is to see her daughter do the same. She has a list of “eligible young men” and a prepared interview she gives to potential suitors. Like her nephew, #X_0# is given to making hilarious pronouncements, but where #X_1# means to be witty, the humor in #X_0#’s speeches is unintentional. Through the figure of #X_0#, #X_3# manages to satirize the hypocrisy and stupidity of the British aristocracy. #X_0# values ignorance, which she sees as “a delicate exotic fruit.” When she gives a dinner party, she prefers her husband to eat downstairs with the servants. She is cunning, narrow-minded, authoritarian, and possibly the most quotable character in the play.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s governess. #X_0# is an endless source of pedantic bromides and clichés. She highly approves of #X_3#’s presumed respectability and harshly criticizes his “unfortunate” brother. Puritan though she is, #X_0#’s severe pronouncements have a way of going so far over the top that they inspire laughter. Despite her rigidity, #X_0# seems to have a softer side. She speaks of having once written a novel whose manuscript was “lost” or “abandoned.” Also, she entertains romantic feelings for Dr. #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The rector on #X_4#’s estate. Both #X_4# and #X_2# approach Dr. #X_3# to request that they be christened “Ernest.” Dr. #X_3# entertains secret romantic feelings for Miss #X_5#. The initials after his name stand for “Doctor of Divinity.”

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The butler at #Y_0#, #X_1#’s estate in the country. #X_0# appears only in Acts II and III.

-- #X_0# --
The book’s protagonist and a pseudonym for the author. #X_0# begins life innocently, unaware of her enslaved state. In the face of betrayal and harassment at the hands of her white masters, she soon develops the knowledge, skills, and determination that she needs to defend herself. #X_0# is torn between a desire for personal freedom and a feeling of responsibility to her family, particularly her children.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s master, enemy, and would-be lover. Although #X_0# has the legal right to “use” #X_1# in any way he chooses, he seeks to seduce her by means of threats and trickery rather than outright force. #X_1#’s rebelliousness enrages him, and he becomes obsessed with the idea of breaking her will. Throughout the long battle over #X_1#’s right to own herself, #X_0# never shows any sign of remorse or understanding that she is a person with rights and feelings.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s maternal grandmother and chief ally. #X_0# is pious and patient, suffering silently as she watches her children and grandchildren sold off and abused by their masters. #X_0# also represents a kind of maternal selfishness, grieving when her loved ones escape to freedom because she will never see them again. For her, family ties must be preserved at all costs, even if it means a life spent in slavery.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mistress and Dr. #X_0#’s jealous wife. #X_0# is characterized mainly by her hypocrisy. She is a church woman who supposedly suffers from weak nerves, but she treats her slaves with callousness and brutality. #X_0# demonstrates how the slave system has distorted the character of southern women.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s white lover and the father of her children. #X_0# has a kindlier nature than Dr. #X_1#, but he feels no real love or responsibility for his mixed-race children. He repeatedly breaks his promises to #X_2# that he will free them.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s beloved uncle, a slave who defies and beats his master and then runs away. #X_0#’s successful escape inspires #X_2#, but also shows her that to run away means to give up all family and community ties.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s children with Mr. #X_2#. #X_1# loves #X_0# passionately, and her feelings about them drive the book’s action. #X_0# are dutiful children but otherwise are not characterized in great detail.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s other uncle, instrumental in her escape. #X_0# is reliable and moderate, remaining in the South with his family long after his mother, Aunt #X_2#, buys his freedom.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s brother, to whom she is close. #X_0#’s escape from Mr. #X_2#, his relatively “kind” master, shows that even a privileged slave desires freedom above all else.

Dr. #X_0#’s daughter and #X_1#’s legal “owner.” #X_0# serves mainly as Dr. #X_0#’s puppet, sometimes writing #X_1# letters in her name, trying to trick her into returning to Dr. #X_0#.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
Mr. #X_2#’s #Y_1# cousin, to whom he “gives” #X_1#. #X_0# is a little slice of the Old South in #Y_0#, selfishly treating #X_1# as property and highlighting the continued danger for escaped slaves even after they reach #Y_2#.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is a being in the Kingdom of #X_2#, a world that #X_1# created as a defense against a confusing and frightening reality.

-- #X_0# --
The author and protagonist of Inferno; the focus of all action and interaction with other characters. Because #X_0# chose to present his fictional poem as a record of events that actually happened to him, a wide gulf between #X_0# the poet and #X_0# the character pervades the poem. For instance, #X_0# the poet often portrays #X_0# the character as compassionate and sympathetic at the sight of suffering sinners, but #X_0# the poet chose to place them in #X_1# and devised their suffering. As a result, if #X_0# the character is at all representative of #X_0# the poet, he is a very simplified version: sympathetic, somewhat fearful of danger, and confused both morally and intellectually by his experience in #X_1#. As the poem progresses, #X_0# the character gradually learns to abandon his sympathy and adopt a more pitiless attitude toward the punishment of sinners, which he views as merely a reflection of divine justice.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s guide through the depths of Hell. Historically, #X_0# lived in the first century b.c., in what is now northern #Y_0#. Scholars consider him the greatest of the Latin poets. His masterpiece, the Aeneid, tells the story of how Aeneas, along with fellow survivors of the defeat of Troy, came to found Rome. The shade (or spirit) of #X_0# that appears in Inferno has been condemned to an eternity in Hell because he lived prior to Christ’s appearance on Earth (and thus prior to the possibility of redemption in Him). Nonetheless, #X_0# has now received orders to lead #X_1# through Hell on his spiritual journey. #X_0# proves a wise, resourceful, and commanding presence, but he often seems helpless to protect #X_1# from the true dangers of Hell. Critics generally consider #X_0# an allegorical representation of human reason—both in its immense power and in its inferiority to faith in God.

-- #X_0# --
One of the blessed in Heaven, #X_0# aids #X_1#’s journey by asking an angel to find #X_2# and bid him guide #X_1# through Hell. Like #X_1# and #X_2#, #X_0# corresponds to a historical personage. Although the details of her life remain uncertain, we know that #X_1# fell passionately in love with her as a young man and never fell out of it. She has a limited role in Inferno but becomes more prominent in Purgatorio and Paradiso. In fact, #X_1#’s entire imaginary journey throughout the afterlife aims, in part, to find #X_0#, whom he has lost on Earth because of her early death. Critics generally view #X_0# as an allegorical representation of spiritual love.

An advisor to Pope #X_1#, #X_0# #X_0# was promised anticipatory absolution—forgiveness for a sin given prior to the perpetration of the sin itself. Da #X_0# now suffers in Hell, since absolution cannot be gained without repentance and it is impossible to repent a sin before committing it.

The patriarch of the #X_0# family. #X_0# is a “rather portentous” man “in his fifties” who owns a profitable manufacturing company. His business success allows the #X_0#s to live in upper-middle-class comfort. #X_0# believes that capitalist principles of individual willpower and the protection of company profits are good for business and good for society. On the night the play takes place, he is hosting a dinner at which #X_2# and his daughter #X_3# are guests of honor.

-- #X_0# --
The matriarch of the #X_0# family. #X_0# is described in the play’s performance notes as “cold.” Though she is pleased her daughter #X_1# is engaged to be married, she tends to ignore any potential discord in the family. #X_0# serves on a charitable committee in the town, and busies herself with social events befitting a woman whose husband is a business success. She protects what she perceives to be the family’s good image and standing in the community.

-- #X_0# --
Daughter of #X_1# and #X_4#. #X_0#, “in her early twenties,” is engaged to #X_3# and believes, at the start of the play, that her future lies bright before her. But knowledge of her role, and the family’s role, in #X_2#/Daisy’s death devastates #X_0#, who wonders how her family can go on afterward, pretending simply that nothing has happened.

-- #X_0# --
Son of #X_1# and #X_3#, and older brother of #X_2#. #X_0# works part-time at the family business and has a drinking problem that he hides, with some success, from his parents and sister. When it is revealed that #X_0# had a romantic relationship with a woman, resulting in a child born out of wedlock, the family must confront facts about #X_0#’s life, and about their own, which they had sought previously to ignore.

-- #X_0# --
Fiancé to #X_3#, and son of another prominent manufacturing family. #X_0# is from a more socially-elevated family, and #X_1# worries that #X_0#’s parents believe he is making a “poor match” in marrying #X_3#. Although the Inspector criticizes #X_0#’s affair with #X_2#, the Inspector notes that #X_0# is perhaps the least culpable, and most morally upright, of all the characters.

-- #X_0# --
A representative, supposedly, of the local police force, sent to investigate #X_2# Smith/Daisy Renton’s suicide. The #X_0# asks all the #X_1#, and #X_4#, questions about #X_2#/Daisy. It seems that the #X_0# knows the answer to everything he asks, but wants the family to admit to various instances of wrongdoing. At the close of the play, the characters wonder aloud whether the #X_0# is actually a policeman, and the constabulary confirms that no such man serves on the force. But this does not explain why the #X_0#, who seems to have socialist sympathies, would have come to the house, or how he could have known so much about #X_2#/Daisy and the #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_1#’ maid. #X_0# mostly sets the scenes in which the family eats and talks. She is not, like the #X_1#, of the upper-middle class, but instead makes money by virtue of her labor. #X_0# leaves the room at the end of the play without mention of her absence or whereabouts.

-- #X_0# --
The victim in the play, and its most mysterious character. Inspector #X_7# begins by telling #X_2# that a girl named #X_0# Smith has killed herself, and #X_2# recalls a girl of that name in his employ whom he dismissed because she asked for a raise. Other characters claim to know different girls of different names, including “Daisy #X_0#,” who, the Inspector asserts, are all the same person. But the Inspector only shows #X_0#/Daisy’s photograph to one person at a time, causing #X_6# to wonder, just before the play’s end, whether the Inspector has tricked the family into combining incidents involving separate girls into one. This revelation is again undercut when, at the very close of the play, #X_2# receives word that an unnamed girl has died in the local hospital from ingesting disinfectant.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# nameless protagonist of the novel. #X_0# is the “invisible man” of the title. A Black man in 1930s #Y_0#, the #X_0# considers himself invisible because people never see his true self beneath the roles that stereotype and racial prejudice compel him to play. Though the #X_0# is intelligent, deeply introspective, and highly gifted with language, the experiences that he relates demonstrate that he was naïve in his youth. As the novel progresses, the #X_0#’s illusions are gradually destroyed through his experiences as a student at college, as a worker at the #Y_2# plant, and as a member of a political organization known as the #Y_1#. Shedding his blindness, he struggles to arrive at a conception of his identity that honors his complexity as an individual without sacrificing social responsibility.

-- #X_0# --
The white and blindly loyal leader of the #X_0#hood, a political organization that professes to defend the rights of the socially oppressed. Although he initially seems compassionate, intelligent, and kind, and he claims to uphold the rights of the socially oppressed, #X_0# actually possesses racist viewpoints and is unable to see people as anything other than tools. His glass eye and his red hair symbolize his blindness and his communism, respectively.

-- #X_0# --
A Black member of the #Y_0# and a resident of Harlem. #X_0# is passionate, handsome, articulate, and intelligent. He eventually parts ways with the #Y_0#, though it remains unclear whether a falling-out has taken place, or whether he has simply become disillusioned with the group. He begins selling #Y_1# dolls on the street, seemingly both perpetrating and mocking the offensive stereotype of the lazy and servile slave that the dolls represent.

-- #X_0# --
A stout, flamboyant, charismatic, angry man with a flair for public agitation. #X_0# represents the Black nationalist movement, which advocates the violent overthrow of white supremacy. #X_2# seems to use him to comment on the Black nationalist leader #X_3#, who believed that Blacks would never achieve freedom in white society. A maverick, #X_0# frequently opposes the #Y_0# and the narrator, often violently, and incites riots in #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A white woman whom the narrator attempts to use to find out information about the #Y_0#. #X_0# instead uses the narrator to act out her fantasy of being raped by a “savage” Black man.

-- #X_0# --
A surreal figure who never appears in the book except by reputation. #X_0# possesses a seemingly infinite number of identities, among them pimp, bookie, and preacher who speaks on the subject of “invisibility.” When the narrator wears dark glasses in #Y_0# one day, many people mistake him for #X_0#. The narrator realizes that #X_0#’s shape-shifting capacity represents a life of extreme freedom, complexity, and possibility. He also recognizes that this capacity fosters a cynical and manipulative inauthenticity. #X_0# thus figures crucially in the book’s larger examination of the problem of identity and self-conception.

-- #X_0# --
The president at the narrator’s college. #X_0# proves selfish, ambitious, and treacherous. He is a Black man who puts on a mask of servility to the white community. Driven by his desire to maintain his status and power, he declares that he would see every Black man in the country lynched before he would give up his position of authority.

-- #X_0# --
One of the wealthy white trustees at the narrator’s college. #X_0# is a narcissistic man who treats the narrator as a tally on his scorecard—that is, as proof that he is liberal-minded and philanthropic. #X_0#’s wistful remarks about his daughter add an eerie quality of longing to his fascination with the story of #X_1# incest.

-- #X_0# --
A preacher from #Y_0# who visits the narrator’s college. #X_0# #X_0#’s fervent praise of the #X_3#’s “vision” strikes an inadvertently ironic note, because he himself is blind. With #X_0#’s first name, #X_2# makes reference to the Greek poet #X_0#, another blind orator who praised great heroes in his epic poems. #X_2# uses #X_0# to satirize the college’s desire to transform the #X_3# into a similarly mythic hero.

-- #X_0# --
An uneducated Black man who impregnated his own daughter and who lives on the outskirts of the narrator’s college campus.

-- #X_0# --
An institutionalized Black man who makes bitterly insightful remarks about race relations. Claiming to be a graduate of the narrator’s college, the #X_0# tries to expose the pitfalls of the school’s ideology. His bold candor angers both the narrator and Mr. #X_1#—the #X_0# exposes their blindness and hypocrisy and points out the sinister nature of their relationship. Although society has deemed him “shell-shocked” and insane, the #X_0# proves to be the only character who speaks the truth in the first part of the novel.

-- #X_0# --
The son of one of the wealthy white trustees (whom the text also calls #X_0#) of the narrator’s college. The younger #X_0# reads the supposed recommendation from Dr. #X_1# and reveals #X_1#’s treachery to the narrator. He expresses sympathy for the narrator and helps him get a job, but he remains too preoccupied with his own problems to help the narrator in any meaningful way.

-- #X_0# --
A serene and motherly Black woman with whom the narrator stays after learning that #Y_0# has banned him. #X_0# treats him kindly and even lets him stay for free. She nurtures his Black identity and urges him to become active in the fight for racial equality.

A mulatta woman, former slave, and the novel’s protagonist. #X_0#’s parents raised her as white, but she eventually embraces her black heritage and later marries a mulatto man, Dr. #X_1#. Even as a slave, #X_0# exhibits inner strength and optimism. She exudes feminist qualities in her independent spirit and her desire to work outside the home as a teacher, accountant, nurse, and staunch advocate for racial equality.

-- #X_0# --
A physician in the #Y_0# hospital and #X_1#’s suitor. #X_0# embodies one of the novel’s main conflicts, that between professing beliefs and living them through action. While he castigates slavery, advocates for blacks’ equal rights, and even vocally supports #X_0# #X_2#’s choice to publicly proclaim himself black, #X_0#, a white man, will marry #X_1# only if she hides her identity as a mulatta woman and opts to pass as white.

-- #X_0# --
A physician, firm proponent of equal rights, and #X_1#’s husband. #X_0#’s scholarly accomplishments challenge #X_0# #X_2#’s beliefs that blacks are intellectually inferior to whites. In dispelling #X_0# #X_2#’s misperceptions of blacks, the mulatto #X_0# resists the racial stereotypes rampant in the nineteenth century. #X_0# is principled and committed to uplifting the black race, and he encourages #X_1# to enlist her talents for the same social cause.

-- #X_0# --
Lieutenant in a black unit of the #Y_0# army, former slave, and #X_1#’s long-lost uncle. #X_0# is literate, articulate, hard working, and courageous. He rallies the slaves in their efforts to abandon the plantations, owns a successful business, and quickly rises in the army’s ranks. Generous and forgiving, #X_0# offers financial support to his former slave mistress after the Civil War dismantles the slave system and her plantation, leaving her destitute. #X_0# is also a mulatto who could pass as white.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s brother, Miss #X_1#’s fiancé, and a soldier in the #Y_0# army’s black regimen. #X_0# initially wavers about his decision to pass as black, unwilling to accept the decline in social status that accompanies such a choice. At times portrayed as lacking confidence and appearing physically weak, #X_0#’s resolve strengthens throughout the novel, and he becomes more assertive and proud of identifying himself as black.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# and #X_2#’s mother, Eugene #X_0#’s wife, and a former slave. As a mulatta herself, #X_0# is conflicted over her husband’s refusal to inform their children of their black heritage. The merciful and compassionate #X_0# cares for her slave master during his illness and his spiritual decline. Overtly maternal, #X_0# is dedicated to her children. She is also industrious and employs her skills in the domestic arts to sustain herself financially.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s white father and a wealthy Southern plantation and slave owner. #X_0# leads a morally depraved and spiritually empty lifestyle fraught with carousing and carelessness until he falls ill.

However, the cautious father overprotects his children and hides their true identities from them.

-- #X_0# --
A Confederate supporter, cousin to #X_1#, and the novel’s antagonist to #X_2# and her family. #X_0#, corrupt and wicked, destroys the #X_3# family for a financial payoff. #X_0# objectifies women and commodifies blacks. That is, he dehumanizes the race as mere property to be sold for monetary gain.

-- #X_0# --
A slave on the #X_1# plantation. #X_0#’s clairvoyant visions reveal her strong faith, as she predicts the slaves’ freedom and ultimate salvation. She also acts as a preacher of sorts who converses regularly with other characters about leading a moral life, and she endorses pro-suffrage and antislavery sentiment. Intelligent and worldly, the feminist #X_0# establishes her own business and contributes her earnings toward purchasing a home for herself and her husband.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s fiancée and a teacher and community leader. #X_0# is a college-educated black woman who represents a model for the race, as she devotes her time to intellectual pursuits and teaching women. Strong-willed and opinionated, yet fraught with feminine decorum, #X_0# freely expresses her views about racial uplift even among a group of men. #X_2# emphasizes that #X_0# is not a mulatta and praises #X_3#’s marriage to this successful black woman.

-- #X_0# --
A resourceful, high-spirited, intelligent slave. #X_0# joins the #Y_0# army with #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s little brother. Two-year-old #X_0# succumbs to illness at the finca.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a woman in the City whose letter falls into #X_1#'s meddling hands.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the play. #X_0#is a Jewish merchant who only cares for his daughter #X_2# and his vast personal fortune. When #X_3# appropriates #X_0#'s estate to help the government pay Turkish tribute, #X_0#is enraged and vows revenge. His clever plots lead to the deaths of many characters, including #X_2# and the governor's son. The protagonist is marked as an outsider within Maltese society because of his religion and because of his Machiavellian cunning. However, in many ways #X_0#is the least hypocritical character in the play. He is generally honest about what motivates his crimes, and he never attempts to justify his actions by religious doctrine. Nevertheless, as #X_0#grows to delight in his own wickedness, we see how many of his murders are in fact motiveless acts driven by hate.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s daughter. #X_0# is initially dutiful to her father and unwittingly helps him mislead #X_4# and #X_2#. However, when she discovers her father's involvement in their deaths, #X_0# decides to convert to Christianity to atone for her sins. Her conversion could be read as a moral climax within the play, for it suggests that the true path to salvation lies in Christian redemption. However, #X_0#'s rejection of her heritage in favor of joining a hypocritical Christian clergy is in many respects unconvincing. #X_3# probably intended this action to be deeply ironic, and as such it reinforces the play's essential ambiguity.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s slave, whom the protagonist vows to make the heir to his estate after #X_1#'s conversion to Christianity. The men share a similar hatred for Christians and vow to cause them as much disruption as they can. Similarly, both are obsessed by money and the power that it affords. However, while #X_2# is a criminal mastermind, #X_0#is more of a common thief and cutthroat. The slave fails his great test of loyalty when he falls for the prostitute #X_4#, bribes #X_3#, and confesses #X_2#'s crimes to the governor. Once again, #X_5# shows how another person close to the protagonist abandons #X_2#. As with #X_1#, the merchant responds to this betrayal by killing #X_0#, along with his cohorts #X_4# and #X_6#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s great enemy and the governor of #Y_0#. #X_0#hides his real motives behind ideals of Christian morality. Ultimately, his role in undermining #X_1# and bribing #X_2# shows how he uses Machiavellian tactics to his own advantage.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator of the Prologue. #X_0# is based on #X_1#, but he is more of an ironic than a genuine characterization of this author. #X_2# uses #X_0# to set the scene for a drama filled with irreligion, intrigue, and duplicity—traits that Elizabethans mistakenly identified as quintessentially #X_1#an. Thus, #X_2# shows his gift at dramatizing contemporary beliefs in a way that may be read as serious or satirical.

-- #X_0# --
The Turkish leader and son of the Ottoman Emperor. #X_3# awards #X_2# the governorship of the island following #X_2#'s help in its capture. #X_3# then becomes embroiled in Maltese politics as #X_2# and #X_4# scheme against one another. Ultimately, #X_4#'s tactics result in #X_3#'s capture, through which #X_5# shows how a great warlord can be felled by Machiavellian intrigue.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s lover and #X_4#'s friend. #X_0# and #X_4# kill each other in a duel masterminded by #X_3#, making #X_0# the first innocent victim of #X_3#'s many plots to exact revenge.

The Dominican friar who converts #X_1#. #X_0# is a flawed priest, who, #X_4# implies, sleeps with nuns and lusts after money. As such, he personifies the hypocrisy of the Catholic clergy. #X_2# frames #X_0# for #X_3#'s murder, and #X_0# is subsequently executed.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#'s friend and a friar, though of a different order from #X_4#. #X_0# fights with #X_4# as both men want #X_2#'s money to go to their own monasteries. #X_0# is strangled with his own belt by #X_3# after #X_2# pretends that he is converting to Christianity.

Friend of the #X_5#. At first, #X_0# is a cook in the #X_2#’s compound. A good provider, he later gets #X_4# a job cutting grass for the railroad. He is a stable presence in the lives of those around him. He is the one who calmly informs #X_4# that his son, #X_3#, has died.

-- #X_0# --
A young man from #Y_1# who dreams of studying at #Y_0# but becomes a stone mason instead.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s cousin. She is unconventional in her beliefs and education, but marries the schoolmaster #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s first wife. She enjoys spending time in bars and in the company of men.

-- #X_0# --
The relative who raised #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The schoolmaster who first introduces #X_1# to the idea of studying at the university. He later marries #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# and #X_1#'s son, raised in #Y_0# by #X_1#'s parents. He is said to have the mind of an old man, though he is a young child.

-- #X_0# --
A supporter of the republic who believes strongly in a government guided by the votes of senators. While #X_0# loves #X_1# as a friend, he opposes the ascension of any single man to the position of dictator, and he fears that #X_1# aspires to such power. #X_0#’s inflexible sense of honor makes it easy for #X_1#’s enemies to manipulate him into believing that #X_1# must die in order to preserve the republic. While the other conspirators act out of envy and rivalry, only #X_0# truly believes that #X_1#’s death will benefit #Y_0#. Unlike #X_1#, #X_0# is able to separate completely his public life from his private life; by giving priority to matters of state, he epitomizes Roman virtue. Torn between his loyalty to #X_1# and his allegiance to the state, #X_0# becomes the tragic hero of the play.

-- #X_0# --
A great Roman general and senator, recently returned to #Y_0# in triumph after a successful military campaign. While his good friend #X_1# worries that #X_0# may aspire to dictatorship over the Roman republic, #X_0# seems to show no such inclination, declining the crown several times. Yet while #X_0# may not be unduly power-hungry, he does possess his share of flaws. He is unable to separate his public life from his private life, and, seduced by the populace’s increasing idealization and idolization of his image, he ignores ill omens and threats against his life, believing himself as eternal as the North Star.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_2#. #X_0# claims allegiance to #X_1# and the conspirators after #X_2#’s death in order to save his own life. Later, however, when speaking a funeral oration over #X_2#’s body, he spectacularly persuades the audience to withdraw its support of #X_1# and instead condemn him as a traitor. With tears on his cheeks and #X_2#’s will in his hand, #X_0# engages masterful rhetoric to stir the crowd to revolt against the conspirators. #X_0#’s desire to exclude Lepidus from the power that #X_0# and #X_3# intend to share hints at his own ambitious nature.

-- #X_0# --
A talented general and longtime acquaintance of #X_3#. #X_0# dislikes the fact that #X_3# has become godlike in the eyes of the Romans. He slyly leads #X_2# to believe that #X_3# has become too powerful and must die, finally converting #X_2# to his cause by sending him forged letters claiming that the Roman people support the death of #X_3#. Impulsive and unscrupulous, #X_0# harbors no illusions about the way the political world works. A shrewd opportunist, he proves successful but lacks integrity.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s wife. #X_0# invests great authority in omens and portents. She warns #X_1# against going to the #Y_0# on the Ides of March, since she has had terrible nightmares and heard reports of many bad omens. Nevertheless, #X_1#’s ambition ultimately causes him to disregard her advice.

-- #X_0# --
Caesar’s adopted son and appointed successor. #X_0#, who had been traveling abroad, returns after Caesar’s death; he then joins with Antony and sets off to fight Cassius and Brutus. Antony tries to control #X_0#’s movements, but #X_0# follows his adopted father’s example and emerges as the authoritative figure, paving the way for his eventual seizure of the reins of Roman government.

-- #X_0# --
A public figure opposed to #X_2#’s rise to power. #X_0# relates to #X_3# and #X_1# how Antony offered the crown to #X_2# three times and how each time #X_2# declined it. He believes, however, that #X_2# is the consummate actor, lulling the populace into believing that he has no personal ambition.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s wife; the daughter of a noble Roman who took sides against Caesar. #X_0#, accustomed to being #X_1#’s confidante, is upset to find him so reluctant to speak his mind when she finds him troubled. #X_1# later hears that #X_0# has killed herself out of grief that Antony and Octavius have become so powerful.

-- #X_0# --
A tribune (an official elected by the people to protect their rights). #X_0# condemns the plebeians for their fickleness in cheering #X_2#, when once they cheered for #X_2#’s enemy Pompey. #X_0# is punished along with Murellus for removing the decorations from #X_2#’s statues during #X_2#’s triumphal parade.

-- #X_0# --
A Roman senator renowned for his oratorical skill. #X_0# speaks at Caesar’s triumphal parade. He later dies at the order of Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus.

-- #X_0# --
The third member of Antony and Octavius’s coalition. Though Antony has a low opinion of #X_0#, Octavius trusts his loyalty.

-- #X_0# --
Like #X_2#, a tribune who condemns the plebeians for their fickleness in cheering #X_1#, when once they cheered for #X_1#’s enemy Pompey. #X_0# and #X_2# are punished for removing the decorations from #X_1#’s statues during #X_1#’s triumphal parade.

-- #X_0# --
A member of the conspiracy. #X_0# convinces #X_1# that #X_2# misinterpreted her dire nightmares and that, in fact, no danger awaits him at the #Y_0#. #X_0# leads #X_1# right into the hands of the conspirators.

-- #X_0# --
A Lithuanian immigrant who comes to #Y_0# with his wife, #X_1#. #X_0# is a strong, determined individual with a faith in the #Y_0#n Dream of self-betterment, but his health, family, and hopes are slowly destroyed by the miserable working and living conditions in #Y_1#. #X_0#, who doesn’t elicit much more from the reader than pity, is an obvious instrument that #Y_2# uses to express his vision of the exploitation of the worker by capitalism and his redemption by socialism.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# stepdaughter and #X_1#’s wife. A kind, lovely, and optimistic girl, #X_0# is ruined by the forces of capitalism that work against the family, particularly after she is raped by her boss, #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s stepmother and the mother of six others. A resilient, strong-willed old woman, #X_0# #X_0# is one of the strongest and most important characters in The Jungle. #X_3# uses her to represent the redemptive power of family, home, and tradition.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s cousin, who travels to #Y_0# with the rest of the family because her employer in the old country is unkind to her. #X_0# is a large, strong woman, capable of standing up for herself; because she first tries to fight back against the corrupt bosses, she represents a spirit of defiance among the immigrants that is slowly crushed.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s boss, who sexually harasses her at the factory where she works. A bullying, depraved man, #X_0# represents the moral corruption of power in #Y_0# as well as the complicated relationship between politics, crime, and business. He has ties to all three and, thus, has the power to destroy #X_1#’s life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father, who travels to #Y_0# with the rest of the family. A proud man, #X_0# #X_0# is prevented by his old age from obtaining a job through normal means. He has to resort to the humiliation of paying a man a third of his wages in return for a job, whose unsanitary and unsafe working conditions destroy his health.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# and #X_2#’s son. #X_0# is a strong, sturdy little boy, but he drowns in the mud in the street while #X_2# is at work. The death of #X_0# signals the death of hope in #X_2#’s life.

-- #X_0# --
The family’s Lithuanian neighbor when they move into their house. A concerned old woman, #X_0# has lived in #Y_1# for many years and has seen one generation after another of immigrants ground into ruin by the merciless labor practices of the factories. She became a socialist before she even came to #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1# two crippled children, injured when a wagon ran over one of his legs when he was a toddler. #X_0# unwittingly helps the family when he meets a rich lady while foraging for food in the local dump.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_2# children, who is forced to care for the children and do household chores. When #X_1# is sent to prison, #X_0# has to go to work selling newspapers on the streets with her able-bodied brothers.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_2# children, a young boy of about fourteen. #X_0# shirks his responsibilities as a wage earner because he is terrified of frostbite. #X_1# often has to beat him to make him go to work.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# brother, who first encourages the family to travel to #Y_0#. After months of poverty in #Y_1#, #X_0# disappears, and the family never hears from him again. His absence deprives the family of a key wage earner and throws them into a greater financial crisis.

-- #X_0# --
A polished, charismatic criminal whom #X_1# meets during his first prison term. #X_0# later introduces #X_1# to #Y_1#’s criminal underworld, where money comes easily to #X_1# for the first time in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The forelady in #X_2#’s factory. Cruel and bitter, #X_0# is the jilted mistress of one of the factory superintendents. She also runs a brothel and arranges to get jobs for some of the prostitutes who work for her. She hates #X_2# because #X_2# is a “decent married girl,” and she and her toadies try to make #X_2# as miserable as possible.

-- #X_0# --
A corrupt, wealthy democrat in #Y_0# who owns the festering dump in which #X_1# and other children forage for food. #X_0# makes money off the housing scheme to which #X_2#’s family falls victim. He works at rigging elections, and #X_2# becomes one of his henchmen during his brief stint in the #Y_0# criminal underworld.

-- #X_0# --
The failing proprietor of a delicatessen in #Y_0# who knows #X_2# from the old country. A kind but troubled man, #X_0# represents the harsh reality of capitalism and reveals the naïveté of #X_3#’s dreams of success.

-- #X_0# --
A paleontologist famous for his studies of fossilized dinosaur nests in #Y_0#. #X_0# is athletic and down-to-earth, and takes pride in not being a stuffy academic like many of his colleagues. Although certain characters seem to resent the presence of #X_1#'s grandchildren, #X_0# likes children and is quickly drawn to #X_2# in particular. The majority of the novel is written from #X_0#'s perspective

-- #X_0# --
The owner of the bioengineering firm #Y_0# and a well-known dinosaur fanatic. #X_0# spends a decade furiously scrambling to clone dinosaurs, partly out of a sincere love of dinosaurs, but also because he is hell-bent on turning his idea into a huge profit. #X_0#'s greed often seems to supercede his judgment: the worse things get in Jurassic Park, the angrier he gets at those who want to shut the park down.

-- #X_0# --
A mathematician who specializes in the emerging field of chaos theory. #X_0# is part of a new breed of mathematician, with a vibrant personality and a wardrobe that seems to consist only of black. One of the original consultants for Jurassic Park, he has always been skeptical that the idea could work. Once #X_0# actually gets to see the island, his predictions of the park's doom get more and more antagonistic, eliciting #X_1#'s anger.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s eleven-year-old grandson. #X_0# is an expert on dinosaurs. When the dinosaurs at #Y_0# start attacking the park's guests, the perspective often shifts #X_0# to heighten the tension. #X_0# is noticeably more mature than his sister, making him the more reliable narrator of what happens to the children.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s younger sister. Whereas #X_2# handles the shocks, scares, and predicaments of Jurassic Park with astonishing grace, #X_0# is prone to cry or whine when the chips are down. She enjoys baseball and teasing her brother, and her young age and close calls with death make her a very sympathetic character.

-- #X_0# --
Jurassic Park's computer technician. #X_0# is hired by the #Y_0# Corporation to steal fifteen of the park's dinosaur embryos. The #Y_0# Corporation is perhaps the novel's major antagonist, embodying the evil, negligent possibilities of bioengineering. #X_0# is smart, fat, and surly, and, in his dealings with #Y_0#, represents the novel's lone antagonist human character. His computer hacking is responsible for all the problems that send Jurassic Park into turmoil.

-- #X_0# --
The head of #Y_1#'s account with the law firm #Y_0#. #X_0# is nervous about the progress of Jurassic Park and has heard rumors of animals getting off the island. He forces #X_2# into bringing #X_1#, #X_4#, and #X_3# in to evaluate the park. Nevertheless, #X_0#'s firm has a stake in #Y_1#, and as soon as he sees the dinosaurs he starts thinking about all the money he can make.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s partner on the #Y_0# fossil dig. #X_0# is an attractive, twenty- four-year-old specialist in paleobotany. Though the first half of the novel banters evasively around the idea that #X_2# and #X_0# might be dating, #X_2# finally reveals to #X_3# that he and #X_0# are not, in fact, romantically involved, as she is actually getting married to a Midwestern doctor sometime in the next year.

-- #X_0# --
A scientist #X_1# has hired directly out of graduate school to begin work on developing a dinosaur cloning process. #X_0# is never very concerned about the animals themselves, and has next to no knowledge about dinosaurs as a species. He is only involved with the park because of the inevitable money and fame such research could bring him.

-- #X_0# --
The park's game warden, formerly a big-game hunter and zoo consultant. #X_0#'s primary task is to keep the dinosaurs from eating people or each other. Irritated that #X_1# refuses give him more firepower to handle large species like the tyrannosaurus, #X_0# is more concerned about the raptors, which are totally unmanageable. He thinks they should all be terminated.

-- #X_0# --
The park publicist who feels annoyed that he must play babysitter to the park visitors.

-- #X_0# --
The head engineer at Jurassic Park, who previously worked with missiles and at amusement parks. #X_0#, confident that he can control the entire park virtually by himself, claims that #X_1#'s predictions for the park represent a misapplication of chaos theory.

The in-house veterinarian at #Y_0# who treats a sick stegosaurus as the tour group passes by.

-- #X_0# --

A doctor who works at a medical center in #Y_0#. On duty one night at the beginning of the novel, #X_1# is called to treat an #Y_1# employee who has allegedly been injured in a construction accident. The employee's wounds are suspicious, however, leading #X_1# to believe that #Y_1# is not telling the truth about the accident.

-- #X_0# --
Dr. #X_2#'s paramedic, who is distressed by the injuries to the #Y_0# employee and thinks they were caused by a hupia.

A family vacationing in #Y_0#. #X_0#, the young daughter, is attacked by mysterious lizards on the beach at the beginning of the novel.

-- #X_0# --
The doctor who treats #X_3# Bowman in #Y_0#. #X_0# is not an expert on lizards, so he refers #X_3#'s case to #X_0# #X_2#, who is more knowledgeable.

-- #X_0# --
An American doctor in #Y_1# who believes #X_2# has been attacked by a basilisk lizard. However, #X_0# later finds a carcass of a lizard matching #X_2#'s description. It is not a basilisk, so he sends it to #Y_0# for identification.

-- #X_0# --
A leading world authority on lizards who works at #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A flamboyant but skilled warrior from the Scottish Highlands. #X_0# is a Jacobite rebel, and he is fiercely loyal to his clan and countrymen. He is an excellent swordsman and marksman, but he is also a braggart.

The King's Factor, or agent, in the Highlands. Unlike most of the Highland clans, the #X_0#s are not Jacobites, and are loyal to #Y_0#. #X_0# #X_0# is plotting to evict all the Jacobite Stewarts from their homes when he is murdered.

-- #X_0# --
The leader of the #X_4# clan (the clan of #X_2#). Like most Highland chieftains, #X_0# has been stripped of his powers by the English government. When #X_3# is murdered, #X_0# is quickly accused of having been involved.

-- #X_0# --
Like #X_1#, #X_0# is a former chieftain stripped of his powers by the English government. Marked for death by the English after leading Jacobite troops against the English army, #X_0# now hides in a treehouse near the mountain of Ben Alder.

-- #X_0# --
An old catechist (religious instructor) who befriends #X_1# as he walks through the Highlands.

-- #X_0# --
David's father. Once, #X_0# and his brother Ebenezer had a fight over a woman (David's future mother). #X_0# was the elder brother, but he made a deal: he married David's mother, and Ebenezer kept #Y_0#, their estate. #X_0# has died by the beginning of Kidnapped.

-- #X_0# --
A son of the famous Scottish nationalist #X_3# Macgregor. #X_0# is also a foe of #X_1#, since #X_3# was a #X_2#.

The second officer of the #Y_0#. He is kinder to #X_3# than the other soldiers, and helps #X_2# escape after the ship wrecks on the Torran Rocks.

-- #X_0# --

The first officer of the #Y_0#. #X_0# is monstrous when drinking, and actually kills the cabin boy, #X_3#, in a drunken rage. He is later himself killed by #X_2# in the battle of #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
Confederacy. The Commander of the Army of Northern #Y_0#, or Confederate army. At the age of fifty-seven, #X_0# has become one of the most famous—and most revered—men in the South. He has led his army through a string of victories. At the time of the Battle of Gettysburg, #X_0# is having heart trouble, and he eventually dies of heart disease in 1870. In his foreword, #X_2# writes that #X_0# is “a man in control. He does not lose his temper nor his faith. He believes absolutely in God. He loves #Y_0# above all, the mystic dirt of home. He is the most beloved man in either army.”

-- #X_0# --
Confederacy. #X_2#’s second in command and, since the death of “#X_4#, his most important general. At forty-two, #X_0# is full-bearded, slow talking, and crude. He is aware of the new nature of warfare, and he knows that military tactics have to change with new technology. He is very stubborn, but he has great respect for Robert E. #X_2#, and ultimately he defers to his commander’s judgment, though not without a good deal of argument. All three of his children were killed by a fever during the winter before the Battle of Gettysburg. This loss has sunk the usually jovial #X_0# into a depression that is severe at times.

-- #X_0# --
#Y_5#. Thirty-four years old, #X_0# has left his home in #Y_3# and a comfortable professorship at #Y_0# College to come to war. He is the colonel of the Twentieth #Y_3# Infantry regiment. He was an excellent student at school, speaks seven languages, and has a lovely singing voice, but all his life he has wanted to be a soldier. He lied to #Y_0# and told them he was going on sabbatical to #Y_2# because they would not let him go to war. He is an intellectual, given to brooding and poetic thoughts.

-- #X_0# --
#Y_0#. A cavalry commander, #X_0# comes from the great plains of the Midwest, and dislikes the tame and political East. He has an eye for finding the best ground on a battlefield. He has been given two brigades and ordered to follow the movements of the Confederate army.

-- #X_0# --
An Englishman sent to observe the Confederate army in action. Many people in the #Y_0# hold out hope that #Y_1# will come to their aid, since the South still bears many of the traditional aspects of English society, particularly in its class structure. But realists like #X_3# and #X_4# know that #Y_1# will never help the #Y_0# as long as it endorses slavery. #X_0# is tall and thin and reminds #X_4# of #X_1#. #X_0# is dismayed by the rough manners of many of the soldiers, but he is also amazed at how much the Southerners are like Englishmen. He especially admires Robert E. #X_3# and #X_2#. He is very enthusiastic about the battles, but he rarely has any idea of what is really going on.

-- #X_0# --
Confederacy. Perfumed, with bouncing curly hair, #X_0# #X_0# is a true dandy. Last in his class at #Y_0#, #X_0# has nonetheless risen to the rank of major general, and he leads an entire division. He is in love with a girl half his age and, in his typical melodramatic style, he has sworn to her that he would never drink. His division has not seen action in battle yet, and he longs for a chance to prove himself and his men.

-- #X_0# --
Confederacy. #X_0# is the cavalry leader assigned by #X_2# to track the movements of the #Y_0# army. A fun-loving publicity hound, #X_0# is off joyriding for the first two days of the battle, and it is his negligence that causes the Confederate army to lose track of the #Y_0# troops in the first place. Because of #X_0#’s absence, during the first two days the Confederates never know where the #Y_0# troops are or what the surrounding area looks like.

-- #X_0# --
#Y_1#. #X_1#’s brother and aide, also in the Twentieth #Y_0#. Not as smart or as brooding as his brother, #X_3# is more social, funnier, and more easygoing. While he has been a calming presence to his brother, he soon becomes a liability when #X_1# #X_0# realizes that he might, at some point, order his brother to his death.

-- #X_0# --
Confederacy. At forty-six, #X_0# is a widower, and his wife’s death constantly causes him sorrow. A general serving in #X_3#’s division, #X_0# knows that his old friend, Winfield #X_1#, is on the other side of the war, serving as a general in the #Y_0# army. #X_0# and #X_1# will both be at the Battle of Gettysburg.

-- #X_0# --
Confederacy. Recently chosen to replace part of “Stonewall” #X_1#’s command, #X_0# has become unsure of himself after suffering an injury that cost him his leg. As #X_1#’s replacement, #X_0# has a great amount of responsibility, which is a source of concern to #X_3#. #X_3# is particularly troubled by the way that #X_0# defers to #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
Confederacy. A young, ambitious, and cold general. Like #X_3#, he has been given a part of #X_4#’s old command. He accepts this responsibility easily. He is capable and confident, but also pushy, particularly with #X_3#. Though #X_3# technically has the greater responsibility and the greater control, he defers to #X_0#. #X_5# and #X_2# despise #X_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#Y_0#. A former sergeant who was demoted to private for drunkenly assaulting a fellow officer. A big, stocky Irishman, #X_0# is getting old and knows he does not have many fights left in him. He becomes a friend and mentor to his colonel, #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#Y_1#. An intelligent infantry general who has a gift for positioning troops, #X_0# refuses to become the commander of the #Y_1# army, a position that is then given to #X_2#. #X_0# is killed shortly after the action begins at #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#Y_0#. Recently appointed commander of the #Y_0# armies, #X_0# arrives a bit late to the Battle of Gettysburg. Cautious but intelligent, he makes only a brief appearance in The Killer Angels.

-- #X_0# --
Confederate. An aide to #X_1#. #X_2# is a competent but not very sociable man.

-- #X_0# --
Confederate. A major general under #X_2#’s command, #X_0# is #X_2#’s most competent soldier. Like #X_2#, he prefers defensive strategies, and he understands that the nature of war is changing.

-- #X_0# --
Confederate. An old general who participates in #X_1#’s Charge.

-- #X_0# --
#Y_1#. A competent, important general of the #Y_1# army, who directs much of the action at #Y_0#. He is an old friend of Confederate #X_0# #X_1#, who fights on the other side at #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
Confederate. A general whose troops do much of the fighting on the first day of the battle, first with #Y_0# #X_0# #X_1#’s cavalry, then #X_2# infantry.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist and narrator of the novel. To save the future existence of her family, #X_0# must repeatedly save the life of #X_1#, the man who fathered one of her ancestors. Although #X_1# enslaves her and abuses her, #X_0# cares for him. When she time travels, #X_0# must struggle to maintain her identity as a strong, intelligent, free black woman in a world in which women and all black people are utterly subservient to ignorant, cruel white men.

-- #X_0# --
The inconsistent, power-drunk slave owner and the father of one of #X_2#’s ancestors. #X_0# rapes and enslaves #X_1# and attempts to rape and enslave #X_2#. He longs to be loved but expects to always get his way, using coercion and violence if he is denied.

-- #X_0# --
A slave forced to bear #X_2#’s children. #X_0# is like an antebellum-South version of #X_1#, a living reminder of what #X_1#’s life might have been like had she been born earlier. Although she does not immediately accept her position, #X_0#’s will is broken over time. Pushed too far, she becomes utterly desperate.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s husband and #X_3#’s foil. #X_0# is a relatively progressive white man who married a black woman despite the objections of his family. As a time traveler to the South, he frees slaves. Despite his progressive thinking, however, #X_0# likes to be in control and sulks when he suspects his wife may be enjoying her time with #X_3#. Because it does not affect him personally, #X_0# is blind to much of the injustice around him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father. A cruel, vicious man, #X_0# beats slaves for minor insubordination. When crossed, he can be petulant and violent. In some ways, #X_0# is fair, and he always keeps his word. He protects his slaves because he sees them as an investment. #X_0# suspects that there is much he doesn’t know about the world, and he fears the unknown deeply.

-- #X_0# --
Tom #X_0#’s wife. #X_0# spoils her son and goes half-crazy after her infant twins die. Dim-witted and temperamental, #X_0# lashes out at the slaves. Once she begins using opium, she transforms from a peevish and overwrought woman into a mellow person who is sickeningly sweet to those she formerly abused.

-- #X_0# --
The cook. #X_0# is a slave who loves #X_3# in spite of herself. The sale of her sons scares #X_0# into submission. Unwilling to lose her daughter, she complies with #X_3#’s demands and performs her physically draining work without complaint. #X_0# is mother to #X_1# and grandmother to #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The son of two slaves, #X_2# and #X_1#, and the grandson of #X_4#. Because #X_0#’s father advises him to follow his own path, #X_0# dreams of running away and views freedom as a possibility. Although he is whipped for infractions, #X_0#’s usefulness makes him largely untouchable. As boys, #X_0# and #X_3# are friends. As an adult, however, #X_0# realizes that #X_3# does not view him as a true friend.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s mute daughter and #X_2#’s mother. #X_0# helps everyone and doesn’t make waves. Because she chooses not to interact with whites, and because she is mute, #X_0# succeeds in keeping a low profile. She takes a practical view of #X_1#’s role on the plantation and stands beside #X_1# when other slaves abuse her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s father and #X_1#’s husband. #X_0# teaches his son how to disobey whites’ orders without overtly contradicting them. #X_4# sells #X_0# simply because he tires of his sass, a decision that frightens #X_2# and show that no one is safe from the cruelty and arbitrary whims of whites. #X_0#’s fate demonstrates the ultimate ineffectiveness of passive resistance.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s husband. #X_3#’s treatment of #X_1# fills #X_0# with anger. #X_0#’s fate as a runaway slave serves as a warning to #X_2# and the other characters.

-- #X_0# --
The overseer at the #X_3#’, and a cousin of #X_2#. A cruel and small-minded man, #X_0# shows #X_1# how abusive a white man with power can be. He beats slaves for no good reason and demands physically impossible feats of labor from them. #X_0# is universally feared and hated.

-- #X_0# --
The slave forced to sleep with #X_2# and #X_1#. When her value as a sexual slave is diminished, #X_0# is sold off. She is a kind and helpful person. She fears what eventually comes to pass: that she will be forced to work in the fields so that #X_1# can keep a closer eye on her. #X_0#’s fate shows that slave owners afford no special treatment or consideration even to their lovers.

-- #X_0# --
The field hand who flirts with #X_1#, despite her warnings about #Y_0#’s jealousy. #Y_0# sells #X_0#, separating him from his family, as punishment for exchanging a few innocent words with #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The cleaning woman, who betrays #X_1# to #X_2#. Like some of the other slaves, #X_0#is willing to do whatever she can to protect her own interests. She pays for betraying her fellow slaves, however.

-- #X_0# --
The son of Rufus and #X_2#. #X_0#, who resembles Rufus, is smart and devoted to his mother.

-- #X_0# --
The infant son of #X_3# and #X_2#. #X_0# is born a slave.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s sister. Although as a young person #X_0# is best friends with a black girl, as an adult she takes on the racist mindset of her husband.

-- #X_0# --
The overseer who works at the #X_2#’ following #X_1# departure.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# of England. #X_0# is the third son of #X_3#. His older brother, #X_4# the Lionhearted, was king before him. Legally, his dead brother #X_2#'s son #X_1# should have become the next king, but #X_0# takes the throne because #X_4# appointed him. The legitimacy of his rule is therefore in doubt--but #X_0# is happy to go to war to defend himself. However, his indifference to the decrees of the pope and his willingness to steal from the monasteries threaten his rule as much as the question of his legitimacy. But finally, it is his order to have #X_1# killed that destroys the support of his lords. His robbery of the monasteries leads to his death at the hands of a monk.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s mother, #X_0# encourages #X_2# to have a strong hold on the throne even if his legitimacy is in question. She and #X_1#'s mother argue enthusiastically about who should be the next king. #X_0#'s death in #Y_0# means #X_2# is not adequately informed about the French invasion and briefly leaves him in despair.

-- #X_0# --
The King of #Y_2#, #X_0# is #X_1#'s champion, and demands that #X_3# abdicate in favor of his nephew. Yet #X_0# easily changes his mind and joins with #X_3#'s family in marriage when the citizens of #Y_0# suggest that #X_4# and #X_2# marry. #X_0# is forced to change his mind again when #X_5# insists that he defend the pope and go to war with #X_3#. However, #X_0#'s main problem is that he keeps losing his armies crossing the ocean between #Y_2# and #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
Son of #X_3#'s elder brother, #X_0# is the rightful heir to the throne. His mother, #X_1#, masterminds his attempt to seize the throne, and #X_4# provides the military strength he needs. Yet #X_0# wishes he had nothing to do with the complex political life and dreams of being a simple shepherd. He convinces #X_2# not to kill him, but then dies when he foolishly leaps off the castle walls in an effort to escape.

-- #X_0# --
Illegitimate son of #X_4#, the #X_0#'s proper name is #X_3#; he is named for his father, King #X_3#. He claims his inheritance from his foster father but then gives it to his younger brother, choosing to become a knight instead. At first he is a mischievous figure, urging the French and English to unite to destroy Angers and stealing money from monasteries (at #X_1#'s request), but he soon becomes #X_1#'s main supporter after all the king's lords abandon him. #X_0#speaks directly to the audience, interpreting and analyzing scenes. By the end of the play, his honorable behavior has made him look even better than #X_1#, but he has a string of bad luck when he loses half his army. He is persistent, though; he tries to declare war on #X_2# even after peace has been declared.

-- #X_0# --
Philip's son, #X_0# marries #X_2# and thus becomes another distant heir to the English crown. #X_3# encourages him to seek out this claim, so he attacks #Y_0#. However, his reinforcements are lost in a storm at sea, and #X_0# letss #X_3# broker a peace treaty with #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A messenger from the pope, #X_0# first arrives to ask #X_1# why he has resisted the pope's nomination for archbishop. He excommunicates #X_1# and threatens to excommunicate #X_3# unless he breaks with #X_1#. Later he urges #X_2# to attack #Y_0#, but then accepts #X_1#'s belated recognition of the pope's requests. He tries to convince #X_2# to stop the attack, but fails, until #X_2# loses his army and needs #X_0# to negotiate peace between the nations.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_3#'s men, #X_0# is assigned to look after #X_1#, but #X_3# asks him to kill #X_1#. #X_0# is so touched by #X_1#'s innocence that he cannot kill the boy, and he returns to #X_3# with the false news that #X_1# is dead. When #X_3# accuses #X_0# of having convinced him to kill #X_1# when he didn't want to, #X_0# reveals that he didn't kill #X_1#. Yet when #X_1# is found dead, the nobles assume #X_0# killed him. Later #X_0# is on hand when #X_3# is poisoned at a monastery and he informs the #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s mother, #X_0# convinces #X_5# to be her son's champion in his quest for the throne. After #X_2# is captured, she mourns extravagantly and accuses #X_5# of having sold her out by arranging a marriage between #X_4# and #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
One of John's followers.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#'s men, #X_0# tips the English lords off after he is wounded, telling them #X_1# means to behead them if they beat John's army in the invasion.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_1#'s younger (legitimate) brother, #X_0# claims his father willed his inheritance to him, but the #X_1# possesses it legally because he is their mother's oldest son. But he regains the land when the #X_1# forfeits it.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_1#'s mother, #X_0# committed adultery with Richard the Lionhearted. Her oldest son was therefore illegitimate, though the legal heir to her husband's property.

-- #X_0# --
A messenger from #Y_0#, #X_0# speaks for Philip when he asks John to abdicate in favor of Arthur, beginning the first battles between the nations.

-- #X_0# --
John's son, #X_0# becomes King #X_0# III at John's death, and the lords all swear allegiance to him over his father's dead body.

-- #X_0# --
The aging king of #Y_0# and the protagonist of the play. #X_0# is used to enjoying absolute power and to being flattered, and he does not respond well to being contradicted or challenged. At the beginning of the play, his values are notably hollow—he prioritizes the appearance of love over actual devotion and wishes to maintain the power of a king while unburdening himself of the responsibility. Nevertheless, he inspires loyalty in subjects such as #Y_1#, #X_4#, #X_2#, and #X_3#, all of whom risk their lives for him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s youngest daughter, disowned by her father for refusing to flatter him. #X_0# is held in extremely high regard by all of the good characters in the play—the king of #Y_0# marries her for her virtue alone, overlooking her lack of dowry. She remains loyal to #X_2# despite his cruelty toward her, forgives him, and displays a mild and forbearing temperament even toward her evil sisters, #X_1# and #X_3#. Despite her obvious virtues, #X_0#’s reticence makes her motivations difficult to read, as in her refusal to declare her love for her father at the beginning of the play.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s ruthless oldest daughter and the wife of the duke of #Y_0#. #X_0# is jealous, treacherous, and amoral. #X_3#’s audience would have been particularly shocked at #X_0#’s aggressiveness, a quality that it would not have expected in a female character. She challenges #X_2#’s authority, boldly initiates an affair with #X_1#, and wrests military power away from her husband.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#’s middle daughter and the wife of the duke of #X_1#. #X_0# is as ruthless as #X_3# and as aggressive in all the same ways. In fact, it is difficult to think of any quality that distinguishes her from her sister. When they are not egging each other on to further acts of cruelty, they jealously compete for the same man, #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A nobleman loyal to King #X_2# whose rank, earl, is below that of duke. The first thing we learn about #X_0# is that he is an adulterer, having fathered a bastard son, #X_1#. His fate is in many ways parallel to that of #X_2#: he misjudges which of his children to trust. He appears weak and ineffectual in the early acts, when he is unable to prevent #X_2# from being turned out of his own house, but he later demonstrates that he is also capable of great bravery.

-- #X_0# --
Gloucester’s younger, illegitimate son. #X_0# resents his status as a bastard and schemes to usurp Gloucester’s title and possessions from #X_1#. He is a formidable character, succeeding in almost all of his schemes and wreaking destruction upon virtually all of the other characters.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s older, legitimate son. #X_0# plays many different roles, starting out as a gullible fool easily tricked by his brother, then assuming a disguise as a mad beggar to evade his father’s men, then carrying his impersonation further to aid #X_2# and #X_1#, and finally appearing as an armored champion to avenge his brother’s treason. #X_0#’s propensity for disguises and impersonations makes it difficult to characterize him effectively.

-- #X_0# --
A nobleman of the same rank as #Y_0# who is loyal to King #X_1#. #X_0# spends most of the play disguised as a peasant, calling himself “Caius,” so that he can continue to serve #X_1# even after #X_1# banishes him. He is extremely loyal, but he gets himself into trouble throughout the play by being extremely blunt and outspoken.

-- #X_0# --
The husband of #X_3#’s daughter #X_2#. #X_0# is good at heart, and he eventually denounces and opposes the cruelty of #X_2#, #X_4#, and #X_1#. Yet he is indecisive and lacks foresight, realizing the evil of his allies quite late in the play.

-- #X_0# --
The husband of #X_2#’s daughter #X_3#. Unlike #Y_0#, #X_0# is domineering, cruel, and violent, and he works with his wife and sister-in-law #X_1# to persecute #X_2# and #Y_1#.

#Y_0#’s jester, who uses double-talk and seemingly frivolous songs to give #Y_0# important advice.

The protagonist of the novel, #X_0# is the son of Aigeus, King of Athens, although he believes that he is also the son of Poseidon, the sea-god. #X_0# is strong, brave, and passionate, and his courage and daring make him a natural leader who inspires loyalty in all around him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, also called the Minotauros, is the power-hungry heir to #X_1#'s throne, although he is not the King's son. #X_0# treats other people as objects, and he insults Theseus continually because he refuses to acknowledge his humanity.

-- #X_0# --
King of Athens and Theseus's father. He is a good king but is tired from fighting wars and he does not rule as well as Theseus believes he could rule. He could free his house from the curse of the Mother, but he is unwilling to kill his own son to do so.

-- #X_0# --
Minos's daughter, #X_0# is the Goddess-on-Earth, the highest Cretan priestess. She does not believe in the gods. She falls in love with Theseus and they escape Crete together, but when she takes part in the sacrifice of the King on Naxos, Theseus leaves her.

-- #X_0# --
The Queen's brother, #X_0# is the War Leader in Eleusis. He is greedy and unkind, and he tries to have Theseus killed. #X_0# is killed by Theseus in armed combat, and his own people aid Theseus in that battle.

-- #X_0# --
Theseus' grandfather is King Pittheus of Troizen. He is a good king who tells Theseus about #X_1# and that the king must accept his fate as ruler of the people. Pittheus is a good judge of character and believes Theseus will make a good ruler.

-- #X_0# --
The son of the King of Megara, #X_0# is a good warrior and becomes a good friend of Theseus, although he dies at a young age. #X_0# senses that Theseus will change the customs in Eleusis, and together they sweep clean the Isthmus Road.

-- #X_0# --
The hereditary name given to the King of Eleusis, Theseus wrestles and kills #X_0# in order to assume the title himself. Before Theseus #X_0# would die each year, but Theseus changes some of the customs in the land once he is King.

-- #X_0# --
A priestess of the Mother, the #X_0# is living with Aigeus when Theseus gets to Athens. She wants the King to poison Theseus in order to lift the curse of the Mother that has been laid on his house. When Aigeus sees that Theseus is his son and refuses, she curses Theseus.

-- #X_0# --
The major deity in #Y_1#, #Y_0#, and all of the Minyan areas, #X_0# represents the old religion. Some of the priests and priestesses who worship the #X_0#, like the Queen of #Y_1#, are very resistant to change, and do not wish to allow the worship of any other gods.

-- #X_0# --
The major god throughout the book. Theseus believes that he is #X_0#'s son. The rage of #X_0# causes earthquakes and much other damage, and all seafaring peoples pay tribute to him.

-- #X_0# --
The novel's main narrator. #X_0#is a woman who has suffered a great deal in her life. A Chinese immigrant to #Y_0#, #X_0#, known in #Y_1# as #X_1#, lost her mother at a very young age and entered into an abusive marriage. Her suffering has made her sometimes cynical and always strong. She is a combination of pessimist and optimist that has lived her life trying to keep the past out of her present.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s daughter. #X_0# is the child of Chinese immigrants and is a person who is caught between her American self and her Chinese ancestry and parents. She is married to an American man and feels more American than she does Chinese. She, like her mother, harbor's secrets, and she has not told her mother, when the novel opens, about her multiple sclerosis.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s husband. #X_0# is a regular American "guy." He is a good father and husband but often finds himself out of place #X_3# #X_2#'s Chinese family.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s Aunt, #X_0#is one of the most self-giving characters in the novel. She loves #X_3# very much and is always helping in one way or another. She is kind and sincere, always shedding light and truth on situations.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s best friend, #X_0# is stubborn and also strong. She had grown up in poverty and married into a higher class, survived the war, and, with #X_1#'s help, had immigrated to #Y_0#. She has a selective memory, is an optimist, and is always trying to repair situations.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s first husband. #X_0# was a good man who had done a serious wrong in his life. He marries #X_2# out of guilt for having wronged her sister, but the two turn out to have a good marriage. #X_0# has a high rank in the air force but is humble. He forgives easily and is also easily swayed by his wife.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s second husband. #X_0# loves his wife very much, and it is important for him to look good and strong in front of her. He is not as he seems, however, and is, in some ways weak, as is illustrated by the fact that he takes credit for #X_1# work in getting #X_3# out of prison. Nevertheless, he is a good man.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# mother. She disappears from the novel early on, and yet she plays a central role since she mysteriously disappeared from #X_0# life and changed it forever. She had been a modern #Y_0# woman who had wanted to marry for love and was, instead, forced to take on the position of second wife to a man for whom she did not care. Because she was strong-willed and independent-minded, she escaped her marriage and her station in life, one way or another.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s father. #X_0#is a wealthy and powerful man at the beginning of the story who forces his daughter to live with his brother and his wives so as not to be reminded of #X_2#'s mother. He begins powerful but ends up a weak man with no memory and a lack of will. It is dubious whether he has the capacity to love, but one action—the act of giving his daughter the gold ingots—redeems him somewhat.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# senior wife. #X_0# is stubborn and sneaky. She carries herself with arrogance and yet gives the impression of kindness as she shops with #X_2# for her dowry. She, like #X_3#'s father's other wives, is always full of gossip and jealousy—and she believes that her position in her husband's house gives her power.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s #X_0#s. #X_0#raised #X_1# in #X_1#'s father's house. #X_0# #X_0# is the more conservative of the two, basing her beliefs on ancient Chinese customs. #X_0# #X_0# is younger, yet still conservative. Both treat #X_1# as an outsider of sorts, and yet later, when the war is over, they seem to have real love for her.

-- #X_0# --
The bratty daughter of #X_1#'s Uncle. #X_0# is #X_1#'s cousin. #X_0# and #X_1# grow up together, and #X_0# proves, in her youth, to be at once, vain, conceited, selfish, and insecure. Later in life, #X_0# leaves her marriage and becomes an adamant communist, and yet she is still a "follower."

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s son. #X_0#is a silly boy whom #X_3# pegs as a loser. He is constantly making jokes, is on the verge of losing his job when the novel begins (according to #X_3#), and has already been married several times. It is his marriage, ironically, that brings the family together.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s daughter. #X_0# is married to a physician and is also the daughter of immigrants. She is married to a doctor who had treated #X_2# and, therefore knows about #X_3#'s condition. She is careful around #X_2#, somewhat too careful. This overly "sympathetic" behavior deeply irritates #X_2#. She is also a person that is very concerned with appearances.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# and #X_4#'s young daughters. Both girls are being raised in an American way, and yet they love their grandmother and her stories. #X_0# is older and more confident; #X_0# is younger and gentler, more sentimental.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# and Jimmy #X_0#'s son. #X_0# never appears physically in the novel. He lives and works in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
Referred to as "that bad man," #X_0# was #X_1#'s first husband. He is self- centered, arrogant, ignorant, and ultimately abusive and cruel. The most despised character in the novel, #X_0# is a villain, and throughout the novel he goes on ravages and rampages that cause #X_1# more and more suffering.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s second husband. #X_0# was madly in love with #X_2#. He was a minister and a truly good man, husband, and father, serving as a foil of #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator and the protagonist of the story. #X_0# is the sensitive and intelligent son of a well-to-do businessman in #Y_0#, and he grows up with a sense of entitlement. His best friend is #X_1#, and he goes back and forth between acting as a loyal friend and attacking #X_1# out of jealousy whenever #X_1# receives #X_0#’s father’s affection. #X_0# is a gifted storyteller and grows from aspiring writer to published novelist. His great desire to please his father is the primary motivation for his behavior early in the novel, and it is the main reason he allows #X_1# to be raped. From that point forward, he is driven by his feelings of guilt as he searches to find a way to redeem himself. Ultimately he does so through courage and self-sacrifice, and he tells his story as a form of penance.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s best friend and half-brother as well as a servant of #X_3#’s. #X_0# proves himself a loyal friend to #X_2# repeatedly, defending #X_2# when he is attacked and always being ready to listen. His defining traits are bravery, selflessness, and intelligence, though his smarts are more instinctual than bookish, largely because he is uneducated. As a poor ethnic Hazara, he is considered an inferior in Afghan society, and he is the victim of racism throughout the novel as a result. He is #X_3#’s illegitimate child, though he is not aware of this fact, and he grows up with #X_1# acting as his father. His rape is an early catalyst in the story, and even though he is not present in a significant portion of the novel, he plays a major role throughout.

Yet his shame at having a child with a Hazara woman leads him to hide the fact that #X_3# is his son. Because he cannot love #X_3# openly, he is somewhat distant toward #X_2# and is often hard on him, though he undoubtedly loves him.

The protagonist of the novel. Before her marriage, she is simply #X_3# Reid, an intellectual and social progressive, the daughter of Sir #X_6# and the sister of #X_5#. When she marries Clifford #X_0#, a minor nobleman, #X_3#--or, as she is known throughout the novel, #X_2#--assumes his title, becoming #X_0# #X_0#. #X_0# #X_0#'s Lover chronicles #X_2#'s maturation as a woman and as a sensual being. She comes to despise her weak, ineffectual husband, and to love Oliver #X_7#, the gamekeeper on her husband's estate. In the process of leaving her husband and conceiving a child with #X_7#, #X_0#moves from the heartless, bloodless world of the intelligentsia and aristocracy into a vital and profound connection rooted in sensuality and sexual fulfillment.

-- #X_0# --
The lover in the novel's title. #X_0# is the gamekeeper on #X_1# estate, #Y_0#. He is aloof, sarcastic, intelligent and noble. He was born near #Y_0#, and worked as a blacksmith until he ran off to the army to escape an unhappy marriage. In the army he rose to become a commissioned lieutenant--an unusual position for a member of the working classes--but was forced to leave the army because of a case of pneumonia, which left him in poor health. Disappointed by a string of unfulfilling love affairs, #X_0# lives in quiet isolation, from which he is redeemed by his relationship with #X_2#: the passion unleashed by their lovemaking forges a profound bond between them.

He turns for solace to his nurse and companion, Mrs. #X_1#, who worships him as a nobleman even as she despises him for his casual arrogance. #X_0# represents everything that this novel despises about the modern English nobleman: he is a weak, vain man, but declares his right to rule the lower classes, and he soullessly pursues money and fame through industry and the meaningless manipulation of words. His impotence is symbolic of his failings as a strong, sensual man.

-- #X_0# --
Ivy #X_0# is #X_1#'s nurse and caretaker. She is a competent, complex, still-attractive middle-aged woman.

Throughout his life, he struggles to come to terms with his relationship to his white, landowning and formerly slave-owning, family and with his deep desire to own land.

The protagonist and narrator of the novel, an elementary school teacher in his mid-twenties. #X_0# is intelligent and willful, but also somewhat hypocritical and depressed. A life spent in a segregated, racist community has made him bitter. He has no faith in himself, his society, or his church. He does not believe anything will ever change and thinks escape is the only option. He fears committing himself to a fight he cannot win. This defeatist attitude makes him shun responsibility, and he resents #X_3# and Miss #X_1# for forcing him to help #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
An authoritarian man who runs the prison in #Y_0#. #X_0# resents anyone who trespasses on his domain, especially blacks like #X_3# and Miss #X_2#. He provides blacks with a modicum of freedom and opportunity while maintaining an overarching, white authoritarian superstructure.

-- #X_0# --
The sheriff’s deputy at the #Y_0# jail, he is the only white in the novel who truly sympathizes with the black struggle in the South.

-- #X_0# --
A stubborn white man with a sense of duty, he owns the plantation where #X_1# spent his childhood. #X_0# is not a bad man, but he enjoys his position of power in the quarter. He cherishes the status quo because it allows him to feel superior to people. Like many of his white peers, he causes harm simply by his unwillingness to change.

-- #X_0# --
The white superintendent of schools. Like #X_1#, Dr. #X_0# knowingly maintains the status quo: black oppression under a fundamentally racist system. A hypocrite, #X_0# #X_0# presents a façade of benevolence, but he actually believes that although black children should receive a small amount of religious and patriotic education, they should primarily work the fields as farm hands.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the son of Clytamnestra and Agamemnon and the brother of Electra. The protagonist of The Libation Bearers, #X_0# spends the course of the play preparing to avenge his father's murder. At the end of the play, he carries out this vengeance by killing Aigisthos and Clytamnestra. #X_0# is intelligent and determined, just like his mother. He is well spoken and quick to do whatever is necessary to do justice to his father's memory, even though he knows that he will have to face the consequences.

-- #X_0# --
A companion to #X_1#, #X_0# is present for much of the play although he does not speak a word until the climax of the action. He is a representative of and the mouthpiece for Apollo. His only lines come at the moment when #X_1# hesitates to kill Clytamnestra. #X_0# reminds him of his duties to Apollo, saying that one should rather make enemies of all men than anger the gods. After saying these words, #X_0# becomes silent once more.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#' older sister, #X_0# cared for him as a child and loves him dearly. Since her father Agamemnon's death, she has been treated like a slave in the palace, and tells #X_2# also that #X_1# is about to marry her off in order to break her bond with the house. Like most Greek woman, #X_0# was totally under the power of her father until she was married, at which point she joined her husband's household and was no longer considered part of her original family. #X_0# is fiercely devoted to her father's memory. She loathes her mother and is quick to transfer all of her love to #X_2# when he reappears. After going into the palace in silence at #X_2#' command, she does not reappear again in the play.

-- #X_0# --
Every Greek tragedy had a chorus, although each one was made up of a different body of people. In The Libation Bearers, the chorus is made up of slave women from the palace. They represent the common interests and ideals of society and frequently comment on the action in highly lyrical odes. The chorus of this play differs from those of other famous tragedies in that it influences the course of events by telling characters what to do. From the beginning of the play, when it tells Electra how and for what she should pray to the gods and her father's ghost, the chorus shows itself to be willing to intervene in the action in order to bring about the desired results. Their most significant act comes when they tell #X_1#' nurse, Cilissa, to alter Clytamnestra's message to Aigisthos. Whereas the queen had told Aigisthos to come with his bodyguards, the chorus commands that Cilissa instruct him to come alone. By doing this, they ensure #X_1#'s victory. They are certain that #X_1# is the agent of Justice and they will do anything in their power to help him.

-- #X_0# --
The powerful wife of Agamemnon and mother of Orestes, #X_0# is arguably the tragic hero of The Libation Bearers. She is the sister of Helen of Troy, and cousin to Penelope (Odysseus' wife). Although she does not spend much time on stage in The Libation Bearers, her character has already been fully developed in the preceding play, the Agamemnon, and thus her influences are felt and understood. She is a fiercely protective mother, and went to the lengths of killing Agamemnon in order to avenge the murder of their daughter Iphigineia. She is extremely intelligent and persuasive, although her arguments are of no avail against Orestes when it matters most. Although her lover Aigisthos is ostensibly now king of Argos after Agamemnon's murder, it is #X_0# who really runs the show. She is not afraid to do a man's job in a man's world.

-- #X_0# --
The rather simple nurse of #X_4#, #X_0# plays a small but crucial role in The Libation Bearers. She appears only once, just after #X_4# has told #X_3# that he is a stranger from #Y_0# who comes bearing news of #X_4#'s death. She fulfills two major functions in the drama. First, she tells us that she raised #X_4# from birth, soothing him through his infant nights and breastfeeding him when he was hungry. She thus negates #X_3#'s claim to motherhood of #X_4#. Second, it is she who #X_3# orders to tell #X_2# to come meet the strangers with his bodyguard. After the chorus intervenes, she alters the message so that #X_2# goes alone to meet #X_4#. #X_0# is loyal to #X_4# and #X_1#, and resents #X_3#'s treacheries. Without her, #X_4# might not have succeeded in his plan.

-- #X_0# --
The son of Thyestes, #X_0# is a weak character in Aeschylus's version of the myth. In other versions of this story, #X_0#, not Clytamnestra, concocts the plan to kill Agamemnon and then carries out the deed. In the Oresteia, however, #X_0# is a rather minor character and is overshadowed by Clytamnestra, who takes him as her lover but who clearly wears the pants in the relationship. #X_0# has his own reasons for hating Agamemnon, as it was Agamemnon's father Atreus who betrayed #X_0#'s father and killed his two brothers.

-- #X_0# --
The Greek god of light, civilization and learning, #X_0# does not appear directly in The Libation Bearers, although his influence is strongly felt. He is represented by his proxy, Pylades. It is #X_0# who sends an oracle to #X_2# that orders him to avenge Agamemnon's murder, threatening gruesome punishments if he should refuse. #X_0#'s designs are at first in line with the ancient order of the #X_1#, as he commands #X_2# to shed blood for blood. However, #X_0# has also promised that #X_2# will not have to pay for his crimes, in direct contrast to the cycle of vengeance. In the Eumenides, #X_0# will advocate in favor of #X_2# against Clytamnestra and the #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The Greek god of messages, transitions, travelers, and hidden meanings, #X_0# is invoked several times throughout The Libation Bearers. In the first lines of the play, #X_1# prays to #X_0# to guide him in his quest, asking that he conduct Agamemnon's spirit from the underworld in order to stand by him as he confronts the murderers. The chorus also calls on #X_0# when they pray for #X_1#'s victory, asking him to keep certain things hidden and bring other things to light. In effect, they ask #X_0# to make sure that Clytamnestra and Aigisthos do not recognize the truth before it is too late.

-- #X_0# --
The ancient spirits of vengeance, the #X_0# ensure that no blood crime goes unpunished. They inflict horrible diseases and torment upon those who thwart their laws. Towards the beginning of the play, #X_3# tells us how #X_1# warned that the #X_0# would come after him if he failed to avenge Agamemnon's death. Although #X_3# obeys and carries out their commands, the #X_0# do not favor him because of it, but rather come after him at the end of the play after he has committed matricide. The #X_0# do not play favorites and do not care if their laws tear society apart. In the Eumenides, #X_2# will negotiate a truce wherein the #X_0# cede the rights to judge crimes of murder to the law courts of #Y_0#. By doing so, she harnesses and weakens their power.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# and Electra's father, murdered prior to the beginning of the play by Clytamnestra, his wife. He is a central figure in the play due to the fact that all of the acts of vengeance committed in the play stem directly from his sacrificial murder of his daughter, Iphigineia.

-- #X_0# --
Sister to Orestes and Electra, murdered by her father Agamemnon at Artemis's request during the Trojan War. Clytamnestra avenges her death by killing Agamemnon, continuing and setting in greater motion the cycle of blood violence.

The narrator of the memoir that covers twenty-six years of her life. #X_0# escapes a convent at the age of fifteen and lives her life as a man, joining the army and inciting violence both on and off the battlefield. Although #X_0# does not exhibit significant emotional growth during this time, she is weighed down by the secret that she keeps—that of her biological gender—and much of the focus of her memoir is the price she pays to keep this secret. #X_0# also explores her conflicting feelings about the church and God, as well as her intense patriotism toward her native country, #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the story. #X_0# is the narrator for most of the novel, and his account of his seven months at sea forms the bulk of the story.

A student of zoology and religion, #X_3# is deeply intrigued by the habits and characteristics of animals and people.

-- #X_0# --
The elderly man who tells the author #X_2#’s story during a chance meeting in a #Y_0# coffee shop. He taught #X_2# to swim as a child and bestowed upon him his unusual moniker.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s beloved mother and protector. A book lover, she encourages #X_1# to read widely.

A plain-featured Muslim mystic with the same name as #X_1#’s biology teacher. He works in a bakery. Like the other Mr. #X_0#, this one has a strong effect on #X_1#’s academic plans: his faith leads #X_1# to study religion at college.

-- #X_0# --
One of three important religious figures in the novel. Never given a name, he is outraged when #X_2#, who was raised #X_0#, begins practicing other religions. He and the other two religious leaders are quieted somewhat by #X_2#’s declaration that he just wants to love God.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s protagonist, also known as #X_0# Hines or #X_0# McEachern. In his first appearance in the novel, #X_0# is a young man in his early thirties, dressed in creased serge trousers, a soiled white shirt and tie, and a stiff-brimmed straw hat. A wanderer, he has a rootless, overly independent quality to him that others frequently misinterpret as ruthlessness, loneliness, or pride. Biracial, he is often mistaken for—and “passes” for—a white man. Silent, unfriendly, and brooding, his face consistently projects a cold and quiet look of contempt. Complex, conflicted, and multifaceted, #X_0# overtly sabotages the little happiness that he is able to find for himself and consistently waylays any of his own attempts to find a place of belonging. Ultimately, this

-- #X_0# --
A pregnant teenager from #Y_0#. Orphaned at twelve, #X_0# comes to #Y_2# on foot and by hitching rides on wagons along the way from her home outside #Y_1#. Inexperienced in the ways of the world, she is determined to find the man, #X_1#, who made her pregnant and left her behind with the promise he would eventually send for her. “Young, pleasantfaced, candid, friendly, and alert,” #X_0# is an easygoing presence who seems unconcerned about her unsettled status in life.

-- #X_0# --
A defrocked minister in #X_2#. Tall, overweight, with skin the color of “flour sacking,” #X_0# was once the minister of one of the town’s major churches. He sought the post because his grandfather, a Confederate cavalryman, was gunned down in #X_2# while stealing chickens. Described as a “fifty-year-old outcast,” he was forced to step down after his promiscuous wife died in a fall from a hotel window in #Y_1#. Refusing to leave #X_2#, #X_0# lives as a recluse, displaying his toughness and tenacity in withstanding the gossip, meddling, coercion, and eventual beatings he suffers at the hands of the town residents who had hoped to drive him off.

-- #X_0# --
A mill worker in #Y_0# and the man who is initially misidentified to #X_1# as #X_2#, the father of her baby. In his thirties, hardworking, and devout, #X_0# leads a quietly regimented life—working six days a week and then directing the choir of a rural church—that has continued uninterrupted in the same routine for years. His life drastically shifts, however, when he meets the young, pregnant #X_1#, whose vulnerability and plight trigger his natural instinct to protect and selflessly help others.

-- #X_0# --
A gambler, bootlegger, and con artist. Young and tall, with a distinctive white scar beside his mouth, #X_0# #X_0# first appears in dirty overalls in search of work at the mill. Lazy, yet alert to any situation he can turn to his advantage, #X_0# moves in a confident swagger but has the tendency to jerk his head to the side and to look periodically over his shoulder. A known liar and exaggerator, his shady past and questionable dealings make him an object of mockery and even contempt in the eyes of those who can see through his veneer of self-satisfaction and confidence.

-- #X_0# --
A reclusive lifelong resident of #Y_0#. Born and raised in the house where she still lives on the outskirts of town, Miss #X_0# is still considered a northerner, as her family relocated to the South after Reconstruction. Her grandfather and brother, who supported voting rights for blacks, were killed by a local man, Colonel Sartoris, in an infamous incident that town residents still recount. Subject to rumors and said to have had sexual relations with black men, Miss #X_0# corresponds with and advises the faculties, trustees, and students of various black colleges in the South, occasionally traveling to the campuses to meet with them in person.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# foster father. Mr. #X_0# is a thick-bodied man with a closely cropped brown beard and cold, light-colored eyes. Stern and devout, his religiosity borders on fanaticism and far outweighs the limited reserves of kindness and sympathy that he is able to muster. Blinded by his extreme faith and belief in divine retribution, he displays a marked contempt for humanity and the folly and sin of others. He upholds that hard labor, self-sacrifice, self-denial, and personal suffering are the hallmarks of a life lived in an upstanding and staunchly moral manner. However, he is prone to violence, and his unyielding and authoritarian presence compromises his essential humanity and ultimately provokes the homicidal rage of his foster son.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# foster mother. #X_0# is a timid, hunched woman with a weather-beaten face that makes her look considerably older than her husband. A silent, cringing, somewhat invisible presence in the family, she tries to earn her son’s love and respect by countering her husband’s violence with excessive doting and kindness. She also attempts to forge a closer bond with her adopted son by creating and indulging in secrets that only the two of them share.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# biological grandfather. #X_0# #X_2# is an unkempt, angry, and spiteful man whose violence and extreme behavior have landed him in jail more than once. Infamous for his crazed ravings, he uses his religious fundamentalism to justify his implicit belief in white superiority. His extreme, unyielding sense of right and propriety pollutes his better intentions, causing him to punish and betray those who are closest to him. He shuffles around in a near-catatonic state that is interrupted only by his boisterous attempts to incite the residents of first #Y_1# and then #Y_0# to lynch his grandson.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# biological grandmother. Short, obese, and round-faced, #X_0# is a shadow figure whom few in town recognize, even though she has lived there for years. She is eccentric and emotional, and her tenuous grasp on reality is compromised when the grandson she thought was dead is charged with the murder of Miss #X_1#. #X_0#’s passivity and deference to her husband have led to a series of tragedies—mistakes she desires to make up for only when it is too late.

-- #X_0# --
The dietician at the orphanage. Insecure and spiteful, she allows her paranoia and fear stoke her racist attitudes and vengeful nature.

-- #X_0# --
A prostitute passing for a waitress at the diner in #Y_0#. Crude and earthy, with large hands, #X_0# brings her #Y_1# street smarts to #X_3# and #X_2#’s seedy restaurant, where she seduces #X_1# and takes advantage of his inexperience and naïveté.

-- #X_0# --
The novel's protagonist. #X_0#is a fifteen-year-old boy who, after being raised by Lenni Lenape (#Y_0#) Indians for eleven years, is forced to return to his white family in #Y_1#. Strong-willed, rebellious, and passionate, #X_0#longs to be a noble Indian warrior like his adoptive father, #X_2#. His stubborn teenage nature prevents him from adapting easily to white culture, yet he eventually forges a strong relationship with his younger brother, #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
As a brave, fair, and stoic warrior, #X_0#represents the ideal image of the noble Indian. Although he is a strict leader who rarely shows emotion, #X_0#deeply loves his white son and tries to guide him whenever possible. He is #X_1# hero.

-- #X_0# --
The twenty-year-old soldier #X_0# provides a contrasting viewpoint to #X_1#'s perspective on frontier life. #X_0# was raised near Indians and knows their customs and language. His background causes him to be more sympathetic toward #X_1# than some of the other white characters, but he is still a strong white soldier who adamantly believes in the superiority of whites. He does not understand why #X_1# cannot appreciate the white way of life.

-- #X_0# --
A radical white supremacist and leader of the infamous #Y_0# boys. #X_0# is #X_2#'s large-set and powerful uncle, who believes strongly in the extermination of the Indian race. His aggressive intolerance represents the racist attitudes of many white settlers of the eighteenth century. Like his nephew #X_2#, #X_0# is stubborn, passionate about his feelings, and willing to use violence against those he perceives as enemies.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s white father is viewed by #X_3# as the exact opposite of #X_1#: weak, pale, and insignificant. In actuality, however, #X_0#has been strong enough to endure the extraordinary guilt and sorrow he has felt ever since #X_3# was kidnapped. He cares deeply for his son and never loses hope that #X_3# will come around in the end.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# light-hearted Indian cousin, #X_0#, is his most devoted and loving friend. A young boy who loves to laugh, #X_0# is at times overconfident or naïve about his abilities to outmaneuver the enemy whites.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#'s white mother. #X_0#has been an invalid ever since he was stolen from their family. Like Harry #X_0#, #X_0# loves #X_4# very much and has experienced guilt since his disappearance. She wants desperately to believe that #X_4# will one day give up his Indian ways and refuses to listen to the pessimistic Aunt #X_2#. However, #X_4# views his white mother as disgraceful, since she does not work, as he believes women should.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# and #X_2# friend. #X_0#, is deeply in love with his white wife, who is being returned to #Y_0# as #X_3# is. #X_0# is very critical of white behavior, but his lack of discretion in voicing his opinions proves fatal.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s naïve younger brother. #X_0#seems unaware that #X_1#'s actions or behavior is different from whites'. On the contrary, #X_0#looks up to his older brother and tries to defend him against their less tolerant relatives. A truly loving and understanding character, #X_0#symbolizes hope for the whites, and he represents the innocent children who are destroyed by the ongoing racial war. His relationship with #X_1# is the most powerful bond #X_1# establishes with another white.

-- #X_0# --
True Son's strong-willed and opinionated white aunt very much disapproves of his Indian behavior. She is very outspoken about her feelings of mistrust and anger for the boy, and she worries that his actions are causing the further deterioration of his mother, #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A thin, wise, and elderly man, #X_0# is one of the most respected and accomplished citizens of #Y_0#. He has worked as a colonel and farmer, in addition to being the village pastor. Although he firmly believes in Christian superiority, Pastor #X_0# understands the complex situation that exists between whites and Indians. He is able to see #X_1# perspective on the violent nature of whites, and he is honest about the mistakes he has committed as a military leader.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is an old black slave who works as a basket maker. Like #X_2#, he grew up with an Indian tribe, the Wyandottes of #Y_0#, and misses the freedom of his youth very much. The experiences he has endured in both the Indian and white worlds have given the slave a wise perspective on life, which he is able to share with #X_2# and #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, whose appropriate name means "Bitter," is Little #X_1#'s brother. A bloodthirsty and ruthless man, #X_0#'s character strongly parallels that of Uncle #X_2#. Just as Uncle #X_2# has no mercy for Indians, #X_0# has no compassion for whites and feels justified in killing even white children.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# tells #X_4# that #X_0#is the only person living near #Y_0# who can speak Lenni Lenape, and #X_1# estimates that #X_0#must be one hundred years old. Until #X_3# tells #X_4# that #X_0#is dead, #X_0#represents hope for #X_4# during his first winter in #Y_0#.

"She calls herself the Queen of Narnia thought she has no right to be queen at all, and all the Fauns and Dryands and Naiads and Dwarfs and Animals—at least all the good ones—simply hate her."

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the oldest of the #X_0# children, and he is noble and courageous. He matures into a young man during his first few days in Narnia.

-- #X_0# --

Later, she urges her siblings to search for her friend, #X_5#, when they find that the faun's home is ransacked. In the beginning, she is the protagonist, although #X_1# fills that role later in the novel. We view much of the action through her optimistic eyes, as a foil to the skeptical eyes as #X_2#. #X_4# gives #X_0# a cordial, which she uses to heal the wounded following the battle with the #X_6#'s troops. She is known as Queen #X_0# the Valiant.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
One of the two protagonists of the story. After leaving his home planet and his beloved rose, the prince journeys around the universe, ending up on Earth. Frequently perplexed by the behavior of grown-ups, the prince symbolizes the hope, love, innocence, and insight of childhood that lie dormant in all of us. Though the prince is sociable and meets a number of characters as he travels, he never stops loving and missing the rose on his home planet.

-- #X_0# --
A lonely pilot who, while stranded in the desert, befriends the little prince. #X_0#y spend eight days together in the desert before the little prince returns to his home planet. Although he is discouraged from drawing early in his life because adults cannot understand his drawings, the narrator illustrates his own story and makes several drawings for the little prince. #X_0# narrator is a grown-up, but his view of the world is more like a child’s than an adult’s. After the little prince departs, the narrator feels both refreshed and saddened.

-- #X_0# --
A coquettish flower who has trouble expressing her love for the little prince and consequently drives him away. Simultaneously vain and naïve, she informs the little prince of her love for him too late to persuade him to stay home and not to travel. Throughout the story, she occupies the prince’s thoughts and heart.

-- #X_0# --
Although the fox asks the little prince to tame him, the fox is in some ways the more knowledgeable of the two characters, and he helps steer the prince toward what is important in life. In the secret the fox tells the little prince before they say their good-byes, the fox sums up three important lessons: only the heart can see correctly; the prince’s time away from his planet has made him appreciate his rose more; and love entails responsibility.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# first character the prince meets on Earth, who ultimately sends the prince back to the heavens by biting him. A constant enigma, the snake speaks in riddles and evokes the snake of the Bible, which incites #X_1# and #X_2#’s eviction from Eden by luring them into eating the forbidden fruit.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, harmless trees on Earth, pose a great threat to smaller planets like the prince’s if left unchecked. #X_0#y can squeeze whole planets to pieces with their roots. Although baobabs have no malicious opinions or intentions, they represent the grave danger that can befall people who are too lazy or indifferent to keep a wary eye on the world around them.

-- #X_0# --
On the first planet the little prince visits, he encounters a king who claims to rule the entire universe. While not unkindly, the king’s power is empty. He is able to command people to do only what they already  would do.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# sole resident of the second planet the little prince visits. #X_0# vain man is lonely and craves admiration from all who pass by. However, only by being alone is he assured of being the richest and best-looking man on his planet.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# third person the little prince encounters after leaving home is a drunkard, who spends his days and nights lost in a stupor. #X_0# drunkard is a sad figure, but he is also foolish because he drinks to forget that he is ashamed of drinking.

-- #X_0# --
A caricature of grown-ups who is the fourth person the little prince visits. Too busy even to greet his visitor, the businessman owns all the stars. Yet he cannot remember what they are called and contributes nothing to them. Although the little prince comments on the oddity of the grown-ups he meets, the businessman is the only character the prince actively chastises.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# fifth and most complex figure the prince encounters before landing on Earth. At first, the lamplighter appears to be yet another ridiculous character with no real purpose, but his selfless devotion to his orders earns him the little prince’s admiration. Of all the adults the little prince encounters before reaching Earth, the lamplighter is the only one the prince thinks he could befriend.

-- #X_0# --
r #X_0# sixth and final character the little prince encounters before he lands on Earth. Although the geographer is apparently well-read, he refuses to learn about his own planet, saying it is a job for explorers. He recommends that the little prince visit Earth, and his comments on the ephemeral nature of flowers reveal to the prince that his own flower will not last forever.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# railway switchman works at the hub for the enormous trains that rush back and forth carrying dissatisfied adults from one place to the other. He has more perspective on life than the unhappy, thoughtless passengers his trains ferry.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# salesclerk sells pills that quench thirst on the grounds that people can save up to fifty-three minutes a day if they don’t have to stop to drink. He symbolizes the modern world’s misplaced emphasis on saving time and taking shortcuts.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# sight of the rose garden first leads the prince to believe that his flower is not, in fact, unique. However, with the fox’s guidance, the prince realizes that even so many similar flowers cannot stop his own rose from being unique.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# three-petaled flower lives alone in the desert, watching the occasional caravan pass by. She mistakenly informs the prince that there are only a handful of men in the world and that their lack of roots means they are often blown along.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# little prince’s echo is not really a character, but the little prince mistakes it for one. When he shouts from a mountaintop, he hears his echo and believes that Earth people simply repeat what is said to them.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# first human to discover the prince’s home, Asteroid B-612. When the #X_0# astronomer first presents his discovery, no one believes him on account of his #X_0# costume. Years later, he makes the same presentation wearing Western clothes, and his discovery is well received. #X_0# scientific community’s treatment of the #X_0# astronomer reveals that ignorance propels xenophobia (a fear or hatred of foreigners) and racism.

The husband of #X_3# and the father of #X_2# and #X_1#, he was once a famous actor who toured the #Y_0# with his wife. Because his Irish father abandoned him at age 10, forcing him to work immediately to support himself, he has a strong work ethic and an appreciation for money that leads to strong financial prudence--bordering on stinginess.

-- #X_0# --
The wife of #X_0# and mother of #X_2# and #X_1#, she struggles from a morphine addiction that has lasted over two decades. While she has broken the addiction several times, she always resumes her morphine use after spending more time with her family. She is on morphine in each scene of the play, and her use increases steadily as the day wears on. Although she loves #X_0#, she oftentimes regrets marrying him because of the dreams she had to sacrifice of becoming a nun or a concert pianist.

-- #X_0# --
The elder #X_0# son, he is in his early thirties. Because he squanders money on booze and women, he has to rely on his parents for support. He dropped out of several colleges and has very little ambition, much to the dismay of his parents.

A sufferer of insomnia, he built a sleeping chamber under his house to shield himself from the street noises in #Y_0#. One night, #X_0# falls asleep with the aid of Doctor #X_3# a skilled mesmerist. His house burns down during the night, but #X_0# is protected by his underground chamber. #X_0# is assumed dead, but, a hundred years later, Doctor #X_2# discovers the chamber while preparing the site for the construction of a laboratory. #X_0# has not aged a day, because his body was in a state of suspended animation. #X_0# awakes to an entirely different world--a world without war and poverty. Through Doctor #X_2#, #X_0# learns how these problems have been solved by basing the economy on public rather than private capital. Compared to the nineteenth century, the new world is an astonishing utopia. Every citizen is accorded a high standard of living, and the new economy is vastly more efficient than the old one.

Also known as "Lord #X_0#," or "Tuan #X_0#." The hero of our story, #X_0# is a young man who, inspired by popular literature, goes to sea dreaming of becoming a hero. He gets his chance when the ship he is aboard gets damaged, and fails utterly by abandoning ship with the rest of the crew. Haunted by his failure and stripped of his officer's certificate, he wanders from job to job, finally becoming the manager of a remote trading post. He falls in love with #X_5#, a beautiful, half-native girl, and, by defeating a local bandit, becomes leader of the people. His dreams of heroism lead to his failure to kill a marauding white pirate, Gentleman #X_2#, which in turn leads to the death of #X_3#, his best friend and son of #X_4#, the local chief. #X_0# allows #X_4# to shoot him in retribution.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator of this story and a ship's captain. #X_0# first encounters #X_1# at the inquiry where #X_1# loses his certification. Feeling that #X_1# is "one of us," he takes an interest in him, first helping him find employment as a water clerk and as a trading post manager for #Y_0#, then compulsively piecing together #X_1#'s story and perpetuating it through various retellings. It is #X_0# who filters and interprets most of the narrative for the reader.

-- #X_0# --
Daughter of the Dutch-Malay woman and stepdaughter of #X_1#. She and #X_3# fall in love, and she makes him promise never to leave her. She is a pragmatic woman and encourages #X_3# to fight to survive after #X_2# death. #X_4# encounters her after #X_3#'s death at #Y_0#, where she, broken and saddened, reminds #X_4# that her prediction of #X_3#'s infidelity has come true.

-- #X_0# --
The owner of a large trading post, he sends first #X_1# and then #X_2# to #Y_0#. #X_0# was forced to flee Europe as a young man after becoming involved in revolutionary activities. Having made his way to #Y_1#, he has become successful as a trader. A thoughtful, analytical man who immediately "diagnoses" #X_2# for #X_3#, he collects butterflies and beetles.

-- #X_0# --
A white pirate who, having barely escaped Spanish officials in the #Y_1#, comes to #X_6# hoping to steal some provisions. He is rather famous in this part of the world, and is used as the stock bad guy whenever locals are telling stories. He is proud, terrified of confinement. He and his men are attacked upon arrival in #X_6# by #X_3# and his band, who have had advance warning of their coming. Although he had initially wanted to conquer and loot #X_6#, he realizes he is outnumbered and negotiates with #X_4#. In those negotiations, #X_0# shows that he is aware that #X_4# has a dark past, thereby appealing to #X_4#'s tortured sense of ideals and receiving permission to retreat in safety. #X_0# has been conspiring with #X_2# and #X_7#, though, and on his way back to his ship, he surprises #X_3# and his men at their camp. #X_3# is killed, which will lead to #X_4#'s death. #X_0# and his men are shipwrecked soon after. #X_0# is the only survivor, although he dies soon afterward. #X_5# visits him on his deathbed and gets part of the story from him. #X_0# is an important contrast to #X_4#, as a man who lives a romantic life, but one that is far from moral or idealized. Unlike #X_4#, #X_0# is quick to own up to his past and his fears.

-- #X_0# --
Husband of the Dutch-Malay woman, he is the previous manager of #X_6#'s Patusan post. A bitter, conniving man, he betrays #X_5# to Gentleman #X_2# and causes the death of #X_3#. He is #X_4#'s stepfather, and treats her badly, even asking for #X_5# to give him money in exchange for her.

-- #X_0# --
A #X_0# with a mysterious past, she is #X_2#'s mother and #X_1#'s wife (although #X_1# is not #X_2#'s father). As a favor to her, #X_3# gives #X_1# a post in #Y_0#. She dies a horrible death with #X_1#, who has always tormented her, trying to break down the door to her room.

-- Crew of the Patna
 --
#X_0#'s fellow officers aboard the Patna, they immediately begin to try to leave the damaged ship after the collision. A physically repulsive and dishonorable lot, they flee before the inquiry. One of them, the third engineer, dies of a heart attack on board and is found by rescuers. #X_1# meets with another of them in a hospital. The man is delirious from the effects of alcoholism and is hallucinating pink toads, but he tells #X_1# that he personally watched the Patna sink (the ship did not actually sink). The captain is an enormous, disgusting man who bullies #X_0#. #X_0# encounters another of the engineers in the workplace of his first #Y_0# employer, which causes him (#X_0#) to skip town.

-- #X_0# --
One of the most decorated and respected ship's captains in the area. He is on the board of inquiry that tries #X_1#. Secretly, he makes #X_2# an offer of money to help #X_1# run away. Not long after the inquiry, he commits suicide, motivated by some secret shame. He is implicitly contrasted with #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
Two disreputable characters who offer #X_3#, through #X_4#, a job taking a wreck of a ship to a desolate island to collect guano. Both have questionable pasts and can be compared with both #X_3# and Gentleman #X_2#. The guano-collecting mission, under someone else's command, leaves port and is never heard from again; it is thought to have been wiped out by a hurricane.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# meets the #X_0# in a #Y_0# café many years after the events of the novel. The #X_0# was the man who stayed aboard the damaged Patna as his gunboat towed her back into port. Although his act was heroic, he seems to have been motivated more by duty and professionalism. His prosaic attitude and his failure to describe the mystery of the experience adequately in words disappoints and even disgusts #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
Chief of the #X_2#; a wise, kind old man and a "war-comrade" of #X_5#'s. #X_5# gives #X_4# a silver ring as a token of introduction to #X_0#. #X_0# saves #X_4# after his escape from #X_6#, who had been holding him prisoner. #X_0# is the father of #X_3#, #X_4#'s closest friend. When #X_3# is killed because of #X_4#'s misjudgment, #X_0# shoots and kills #X_4#, who has offered himself up as a sacrifice.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#'s son and #X_5#'s best friend. The two are soul mates, and #X_0# serves as #X_5#'s second-in-command. He leads the initial attack on Gentleman #X_2#, but is not entirely successful, lacking #X_5#'s charisma as a leader of men. He is killed when #X_3# leads #X_2# down the river channel behind his camp, after #X_5# foolishly frees #X_2# and his men.

-- #X_0# --
A group of traders from #Y_0# who immigrate to #Y_1# many years before #X_2# arrives there. They are constantly embroiled in conflict with #X_3#, who wants to shut down their trading activities and enjoy a monopoly for himself. #X_1# is their chief.

-- #X_0# --
A Malay who came to #Y_0# and was enslaved by the Rajah Allang. Freed by #X_1#, he becomes #X_3#'s loyal servant and adviser. He escapes with #X_2# after #X_3#'s death and is the one to give #X_4# the most complete account of #X_3#'s final days.

-- #X_0# --
Also known as Tunku #X_0#. The corrupt, unofficial ruler of #Y_0#; the uncle of the legitimate but underage and possibly mentally-incompetent #X_3#. He tries to enforce a monopoly on trade in the area. #X_0# captures #X_2# upon his arrival in #Y_0#. He also secretly allies with #X_1# against #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A fanatic Muslim bandit who terrorizes #Y_0# from a stronghold in the hills. #X_1# defeats #X_0# to become a hero in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s protagonist, the twelve-year-old English boy who is elected leader of the group of boys marooned on the island. #X_0# attempts to coordinate the boys’ efforts to build a miniature civilization on the island until they can be rescued. #X_0# represents human beings’ civilizing instinct, as opposed to the savage instinct that #X_1# embodies.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s antagonist, one of the older boys stranded on the island. #X_0# becomes the leader of the hunters but longs for total power and becomes increasingly wild, barbaric, and cruel as the novel progresses. #X_0#, adept at manipulating the other boys, represents the instinct of savagery within human beings, as opposed to the civilizing instinct #X_1# represents.

-- #X_0# --
A shy, sensitive boy in the group. #X_0#, in some ways the only naturally “good” character on the island, behaves kindly toward the younger boys and is willing to work for the good of their community. Moreover, because his motivation is rooted in his deep feeling of connectedness to nature, #X_0# is the only character whose sense of morality does not seem to have been imposed by society. #X_0# represents a kind of natural goodness, as opposed to the unbridled evil of #X_1# and the imposed morality of civilization represented by #X_3# and #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s “lieutenant.” A whiny, intellectual boy, #X_0#’s inventiveness frequently leads to innovation, such as the makeshift sundial that the boys use to tell time. #X_0# represents the scientific, rational side of civilization.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s “lieutenant.” A sadistic, cruel older boy who brutalizes the littluns and eventually murders #X_2# by rolling a boulder onto him.

-- #X_0# --
A pair of twins closely allied with #X_2#. #X_0# are always together, and the other boys often treat them as a single entity, calling them “#X_0#neric.” The easily excitable #X_0# are part of the group known as the “bigguns.” At the end of the novel, they fall victim to #X_1#’s manipulation and coercion.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# name given to the sow’s head that #X_2#’s gang impales on a stake and erects in the forest as an offering to the “beast.” #X_0# comes to symbolize the primordial instincts of power and cruelty that take control of #X_2#’s tribe.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# main protagonist of #X_0# Lord of the Rings, a #X_4# of exceptional character. #X_3# is also a friend of the Elves, knowledgeable in their language and a lover of their songs. Like #X_2#—or any other good #X_4#—#X_3# loves good food and simple comforts, but he is also thoughtful and curious and has a wisdom and strength of character that set him apart.

-- #X_0# --
The former gardener at Bag End and #X_2#’s indomitable servant throughout his quest. Although #X_3# is not extraordinarily wise or intelligent, his common sense and powers of observation serve him well. Perhaps most important, he is stubborn, brave, and deeply loyal to #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
One of the five great Wizards in Middle-earth, second in his order only to Saruman. Known to most Hobbits only as a creator of fine fireworks, #X_0# is actually powerful beyond their imagination. He is also wise, humorous, kind, and generous, though sometimes short-tempered.

-- #X_0# --
An Elf from #Y_0#. #X_0# is light on his feet and masterful with a bow. After overcoming initial differences that stem from the historical antipathy between their races, he and the Dwarf #X_2# become fast friends.

-- #X_0# --
A Dwarf, the son of #X_2# (one of Bilbo’s company in The Hobbit). #X_0# bristles when he feels insulted, but he is noble, stalwart, and brave.

-- #X_0# --
The heir of Isildur, one of the few Men from the great race of Númenor left in Middle-earth. #X_0# is also known as #X_2#. Before the coming of the Ring, he lived as a Ranger in the North, protecting the Shire and other lands from servants of the Enemy. #X_0# is a formidable warrior and tracker.

-- #X_0# --
One of the Men of Gondor, from the city of #Y_0# in the south. #X_0# is a valiant fighter and is always trustworthy in battle, but his pride and recklessness make him vulnerable to the Ring’s power.

-- #X_0# --
A young and somewhat rash Hobbit. #X_2# is good-natured and a bit of a smart aleck.

-- #X_0# --
A young Hobbit from #Y_0#. #X_2# has a temperament similar to #X_3#’s, though he is more mature and, unlike most Hobbits, not afraid of boats and water.

-- #X_0# --
The antagonist and title character of The Lord of the Rings. The Dark Lord #X_2#, a servant of #X_1#, the Great Enemy, took his master’s place after the First Age. The enormously powerful #X_2# is never seen at any point in the novel; he is represented only by images of his Great Eye or the Dark Tower where he resides. He fervently desires the One Ring, which he created long ago and which holds a great part of his power. #X_2# is wise, but he only thinks in terms of desire—especially desire for power. He therefore does not understand those who would want to destroy the Ring rather than use it—which is perhaps his only weakness.

-- #X_0# --
The head of #X_2#’s order of Wizards. #X_0# advises the other Wizards not to challenge the growing power of Sauron. #X_2#, who suspects that #X_0# intends to join Sauron’s forces outright, confirms his suspicions when he travels to #X_0#’s tower, Orthanc. #X_0# does not himself appear as a character until The Two Towers, but his presence and influence are clearly felt in The Fellowship of the Ring.

-- #X_0# --
A hunched, miserable creature who was once Sméagol, a young boy of a #X_1#-like race. Sméagol killed his friend Déagol after Déagol found the One Ring on the bottom of the Anduin River.

-- #X_0# --
A mysterious, gigantic, terrifying elemental demon from deep inside the earth. #X_0#, the “nameless fear” awakened by the Dwarves in the Mines of Moria, emerges from the depths when the Fellowship passes through the Mines, and it ultimately confronts #X_1# in an epic battle. #X_0#, which brandishes an enormous flaming sword and whip, is wreathed in flame and yet exudes shadow and darkness.

-- #X_0# --
Squat, swarthy, wretched creatures that are seemingly limitless in number and that serve the purposes of #X_2#. Hordes of #X_0#, which are unable to withstand daylight and therefore emerge almost exclusively at night, pursue the #Y_0# through the Mines of Moria and beyond; it is presumed that the #X_0# are also responsible for the death of #X_1# and the other Dwarves who returned to Moria in an attempt to reclaim the ancient Dwarf realm there.

-- #X_0# --
A swarthy, suspicious fellow in #Y_0# who appears to have been paid off by the Black Riders to watch Frodo’s movements. #X_0# sells the hobbits a half-starved pony at a high price to replace the ponies the Black Riders set loose the night before.

-- #X_0# --
The Master of Rivendell. #X_1# is descended from a Man and an Elf—thus, “Halfelven.” He had the choice to be mortal or immortal and chose the latter. As a consequence, #X_1# must leave Middle-earth when the time comes, most likely at the end of the War of the Ring. He is renowned for his wisdom and learning.

-- #X_0# --
The Lady of Lothlórien and perhaps the wisest of the Elves. #X_0# bears one of the Elven Rings of Power and uses it to read #X_3#’s mind. Like #X_2#, she sometimes appears as less a character than an embodiment of physical, mental, and spiritual perfection.

Another Elf-lord who attends the #Y_0# of Elrond. #X_0# suggests that the Ring be given to Tom #X_1#, over whom it has no power; the others at the #Y_0#, however, worry that even #X_1# could not single-handedly defeat #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The leader of the group of Elves who halt the #Y_0#’s entry into the forest of Lothlórien. #X_0# then leads the #Y_0# into the heart of the forest to meet #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The hero of The Hobbit and #X_3#’s cousin and mentor. #X_2# is clever and loves a good joke or song. The effects of having kept the Ring for so long only occasionally mar his thoughtfulness. #X_2# is an object of curiosity in the #Y_0# for his learning and his wandering ways, and he is trying to write a book detailing his many adventures.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# page.

-- #X_0# --
He is described as "a clown," and therefore fills the role of the fool, a common character in many of #X_3#'s plays. Both Don #X_1# and #X_2# ask him to deliver letters to their respective ladies, but #X_0# accidentally switches the letters.

-- #X_0# --
A country wench caught with #X_1# by #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The narrative of Lucky #X_0# centers on the thoughts and feelings of #X_0# #X_0#, an unremarkable young man about to complete his first year as an assistant lecturer in #Y_1# at a provincial college in #Y_0#. Intolerant of the pretension and hypocrisy of the college's faculty and their families, #X_0# hides his contempt, channeling it into venomous mental outbursts and a wide array of nasty faces. #X_0# can be clumsy and careless, and even sneaky and mean to those he truly hates, but is genuine and compassionate as well.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#holds a slightly higher post than Jim #X_2# at the same college. #X_0# and #X_2# are close, and #X_0# imagines that she knows #X_2# better than anyone else. #X_0# is not very attractive and tries to compensate for this by wearing arty clothing and too much make-up. #X_0# has her moments of straightforward discussion with #X_2#, but can just as quickly become clingy, condescending, or aggressive. She takes advantage of #X_2#'s good-natured concern for her to keep him in a relationship, and even fakes a suicide attempt to attract the concern of either #X_2# or #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is the eldest of Professor #X_0#'s two sons. #X_0# lives in #Y_0#, where he has begun a career as a painter. #X_0# presents himself as cultured, witty, and cosmopolitan, which usually translates into a kind of elitism. #X_0# looks up to the rich and very definitely considers #X_4# to be below him. #X_0# hopes to get a job with #X_3#'s uncle, #X_5#, as the wealthy patron's personal assistant. #X_0# plans to marry #X_3# in a couple of years, even though he is currently having an affair with #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#lives in #Y_0#, and dates #X_1# for most of the novel. #X_0#'s family seems to have money—her uncle is the rich #X_4#-#X_5#—but #X_0# herself works in a bookshop and wears the same outfit every time #X_3# sees her. #X_0# can come off as prissy and prim, but truly enjoys #X_3#'s predicaments and laughs unabashedly. #X_0# is very good-looking and presents herself well, leading #X_3# to believe at first that she would never date a man such as himself.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0# seems to have been holding his job for quite some time. He is an absent-minded man who rambles on about old English music, the recorder, and children's artwork, not noticing whether or not his audience cares. #X_0# is certainly not malicious, but he is an extremely bad driver due his general lack of awareness to things around him. He and his wife have some social pretensions, and they often try to attract the local press to musical events at their house. #X_0# #X_0# believes that things were better in the old days, and wishes he could go back to his sentimentalized ideal of the period in English history when everyone made their own music and artwork.

-- #X_0# --
Mrs. #X_0# seems to be the driving force behind her husband's social ambition. Mrs. #X_0# accompanies the musical parties held at her house on the piano. She is unwilling to forgive #X_1# for anything.

#X_0# #X_0# is #X_5#'s officemate and a senior lecturer in #Y_0# at the college. #X_0# #X_0# is in her forties and is having an affair with #X_2#, which she has told her husband about. #X_5# considers #X_0# to be an ally of his, as she is good at turning people's statements back on them and speaks frankly. #X_5# is also impressed by her "femaleness," which seems mostly to consist of her ability to admit she enjoys sex. The #X_0#s are friends with #X_5# and #X_7#, as well as with the #X_8#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is an insurance salesman who lives in #X_3#'s house and is a drinking friend of #X_3#'s. #X_3# admires #X_0# for the power and style of #X_0#'s contempt for pretty much everything around him. He is a man of few words and Miss #X_2#, the housekeeper, seems afraid of him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# holds a similar position to #X_1#, but in the college's #Y_0#. #X_0# and #X_1# are drinking friends and often walk to college together. #X_0# takes his career and work more seriously than #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#lives in #X_1#'s house and is a staff member at the college. #X_0# plays the oboe at Professor #X_3#'s amateur musical concerts. #X_0# sucks up to the #X_3#es and likes to tell on #X_1# to Mrs. #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# runs the boardinghouse that #X_1# lives in. She is a stereotypical housekeeper.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# never actually appears in the novel, but does speak to #X_1# over the phone. #X_0# is a shady academic who accepts #X_1#'s article for his new academic journal, then steals it and publishes it in Italian under his own name, winning him a position as a department chair at a university in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is a #X_0# of Music at the college. #X_1# likes #X_0#, who helps #X_1# out with material for #X_1#'s "Merrie England" lecture. #X_0#'s biggest appearance in the novel comes when #X_1# steals the taxi the #X_0#and his wife have called to take them home from the Summer Ball.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# of the college is a small, bald-headed man, with a cackling laugh. #X_1# accidentally imitates his notably clipped, consonantal accent when #X_1# gives his lecture.

#X_0#are the three prettiest female students in the history department. #X_0# #X_4# is #X_3#'s girlfriend. #X_1# tries to attract the three women to take his special subject course next fall, and to discourage #X_3# at the same time.

-- #X_0# --
An au pair for a wealthy American family, and the novel’s protagonist and narrator. More than anything, #X_0# wants to escape the influence of her native land, a British-ruled Caribbean island, but her homesickness and difficult relationship with her mother stand in her way. Sharply observant and frequently critical, she grows close to her employers while remaining keenly aware of the disparate circumstances separating her from them. #X_0# unapologetically enjoys her sexual encounters with men but reserves her deepest, most painful feelings for her relationships with women. Though she suffers persistent dissatisfaction and disillusion as her new existence fails to meet her expectations, she also experiences moments of hope and peace and demonstrates great strength and determination in her quest to live on her own terms.

-- #X_0# --
The woman of the household in which #X_1# works. Though #X_0# holds liberal views, she inadvertently offends #X_1# with the naïveté and arrogance of her privileged upbringing. Still, #X_0# demonstrates more generosity and kindness than others in her class, and #X_1# comes to view her as a mother figure. As #X_0#’s marriage declines, she becomes increasingly vulnerable, which leads #X_1# to understand that even the wealthy have problems.

-- #X_0# --
The man of the household in which #X_1# works. Despite his friendliness and good humor, #X_0# epitomizes #X_1#’s worst ideas about men when he cheats on #X_2#. Handsome and rich, he has spent his life getting what he wants with little effort, and #X_1# believes that he manipulates #X_2# into ending their marriage so as to avoid taking blame for the relationship’s demise.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother. Left behind in #X_1#’s homeland, #X_0# makes no physical appearance in the novel, but she nonetheless has an immense presence in #X_1#’s life. Often portrayed as godlike, #X_0# holds a place in #X_1#’s heart as her first, and possibly only, great love. However, she discouraged #X_1#’s educational and career aspirations while supporting her sons’ goals, which infuriates #X_1#. #X_0#’s strained relationship with #X_1# affects all aspects of #X_1#’s life and sparks fears that #X_1# will never overcome her past.

-- #X_0# --
A servant in #X_1# and #X_3#’s household. One of the first people #X_2# meets in #Y_0#, the maid treats #X_2# with hostility and increases her feelings of isolation.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother’s friend. #X_0# has had a difficult existence, which left her with a scar on her cheek that #X_1# views as a symbol of real life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s family’s hired hand. #X_0# brings out #X_1#’s sympathies when #X_2# treats him imperiously, but #X_1#, deciding his Swedish ancestry makes him too different from her, refrains from reaching out to him.

-- #X_0# --
The first important male figure in #X_0# life. A philanderer who kept his distance from #X_2#, he set the stage for #X_0# dismissive attitude toward men. His death gives #X_2# the resolve to leave #X_3# and #X_1#’s apartment.

-- #X_0# --
The boy with whom #X_1# first explores her sexuality. #X_0# and #X_1# share a purely physical bond that arouses #X_1# so much that she grows curious about the pleasures that other boys may have to offer.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# and #X_3#’s youngest daughter. #X_0# reminds #X_2# of herself as a child and of her early experiences with her mother. Though her role in the novel is small, she bears the distinction of being the one person toward whom #X_2# exhibits unconditional love.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# and #X_3#’s oldest daughter. Entering adolescence, #X_0# shows signs of rebellion against #X_3# that recall #X_2#’s initial defiance of her mother.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# and #X_3#’s two other daughters. Though #X_2# focuses little on their individual characteristics, #X_0# share the charming playfulness of all of #X_1# and #X_3#’s brood. #X_2# wishes her own mother had cultivated those traits in her and hopes one day to raise such happy, free-spirited children herself.

-- #X_0# --
An acquaintance who abruptly kisses #X_2#. #X_0# boy and #X_2# meet regularly for wordless sexual encounters until #X_2# grows tired of him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s best friend. #X_0# impresses #X_3# with her generosity and zest for life, but #X_2# finds her arrogant, envious, and vain, a view confirmed when #X_2# catches her sexually involved with #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s best friend. #X_0# impresses #X_1# with her fun-loving, carefree attitude, but the differences between her and #X_1#, as well as #X_1#’s association with #X_3#, eventually come between them. #X_1# often compares their relationship to that of disgruntled lovers, and her inability to maintain closeness with #X_0# shows #X_1#’s difficulty in sustaining her most intimate ties. Still, by renting an apartment with #X_1#, #X_0# serves an important role in #X_1#’s independence from #X_2# and her mother.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s brother and #X_2#’s first North American boyfriend. Intelligent and well-traveled, #X_0# wins over #X_2# with his respectful attitude towards her homeland. He delights #X_2# sexually, but she denies loving him and has no qualms about their parting.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_1#’s mother. Poor and unloved, the nurse evokes #X_1#’s fears about compromising herself in an occupation that her mother encourages but that #X_1# believes falls short of her potential.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s coworker and #X_2#’s lover. Though #X_3# deems him a pervert, #X_0# charms #X_2# with his bright eyes and artistic sensibilities. He and #X_2# embark on an intensely sexual relationship, which drives a wedge between #X_2# and #X_3#. He feels more strongly about #X_2# than she does about him, and she tires of his constant presence at her new apartment.

-- #X_0# --
A camera salesman with whom #X_1# has a fling. Though she quickly jumps into his bed, #X_0# means little to #X_1#. Her romp with him also displays her lack of feeling for #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The woman from #X_1#’s homeland who brings #X_1# news of her father’s death. Though #X_0# strikes #X_1#’s mother as a model of proper behavior, #X_0# serves as a bit of a foil for #X_1#, who finds her sadistic and an inspiration, by negative example, to leave her mother’s home by age nineteen. Despite #X_0#’s unpleasantness, she provides #X_1# some comfort when bringing news of #X_1#’s father’s death, evoking #X_1#’s violently mixed feelings about her native land.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s childhood friend. Abnormally small, #X_0# gladly takes money from a local fisherman, Mr. #X_2#, to let him molest her, a revelation that provokes sexual jealousy in #X_1#. Though #X_1# desperately wants to know how #X_0#’s encounters with Mr. #X_2# felt, she is too inhibited by social convention to ask.

-- #X_0# --
A fisherman from #X_2#’s island who dies at sea. #X_0# always behaved like a gentleman around #X_2#, who wishes he had molested her instead of #X_3#. Years later, #X_4#’s hands cause #X_2# to remember #X_0#, whose hands, forever lost to her, represent the height of sexual mystery.

-- #X_0# --
A photographer and #X_2#’s employer. #X_0# is the first person #X_2# has met who has compromised his art for money. He lets her use his darkroom, facilitating her artistic development.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is an Athenian woman who is sick and tired of war and the treatment of women in #Y_0#. #X_0# gathers the women of #Y_1# and #Y_0# together to solve these social ills and finds success and power in her quest. #X_0# is the least feminine of the women from either #Y_0# or #Y_1#, and her masculinity helps her gain respect among the men.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the next-door neighbor of #X_1# and is the first to show up at #X_1#'s meeting of women. #X_0# embraces her feminine side and is delighted that #X_1#'s scheme for peace involves garments like negligees.

-- #X_0# --
If rank were imposed, #X_0# would be the second strongest woman in Lysistrata. #X_0# is able to seduce her husband, Kinesias, but she refuses sex with him just at the last minute.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is representative of #Y_0#n women. #X_0# is a large, well-built woman who American audiences might imagine with a thick Appalachian accent (by #X_1#'s translation, #Y_0# was the Greek equivalent of the stereotypically South). #X_0# brings the #Y_0#n women into #X_2#'s plan.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a Boitian girl who has a nice body, keeps herself well tended, and is quite possibly mute.

-- #X_0# --
This lady accompanies #X_2# and #X_3# to Lysistrata's meeting and is known for her vast posterior bodily feature.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# kindly offers her shield up for the women to make a sacrifice upon.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0#, a stubborn and rather grouchy fellow, leads the Chorus of Old #X_0# around Athens.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# live up to their title; the chorus is made up of twelve old men who teeter around Athens attempting to keep the women in line. Although, unsuccessful in their civic duties, the #X_0# strike up some fantastical misogynistic melodies and are a generally comedic element of the play.

-- #X_0# --
Like the #X_0# of Men, the #X_0# leads the Chorus of Old #X_0# around. The #X_0# leads a successful seizure of the #Y_0# and outwits the men in every possible way.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# seizes and then protects the Akropolis from the #X_0# of #X_0# Men. The #X_0#, although frail, fights to the last with the men and finds victory in the end.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# is apparently the head of security and law in #Y_0#, but is completely overwhelmed by the women and ends up being dressed as a woman himself. #X_1# has a lengthy conversation with the #X_0# about the future of #Y_0# and peace in the region, but the #X_0# is very slow to understand her logic.

-- #X_0# --
These #X_0# are humiliated again and again by the women. The women, brandishing nothing but lamps, chamber pots and other various household utensils, scare these policemen away.

-- #X_0# --
The needy, desperate clown that #X_1# calls her husband. #X_0# is the first man to be affected by the sex strike and comes to the #Y_0#, fully enflamed.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s handmaid. #X_0# is the unclothed beauty of a woman whom #X_2# displays and uses during her final plea for peace between #Y_0# and #Y_1#. Terribly aroused and uncomfortable, the men quickly discuss the terms of a truce, all the while staring at #X_0#'s body.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a Scottish general and the thane of Glamis who is led to wicked thoughts by the prophecies of the three witches, especially after their prophecy that he will be made thane of Cawdor comes true. #X_0# is a brave soldier and a powerful man, but he is not a virtuous one. He is easily tempted into murder to fulfill his ambitions to the throne, and once he commits his first crime and is crowned King of Scotland, he embarks on further atrocities with increasing ease. Ultimately, #X_0# proves himself better suited to the battlefield than to political intrigue, because he lacks the skills necessary to rule without being a tyrant. His response to every problem is violence and murder. Unlike #X_3#’s great villains, such as #X_1# in Othello and #X_2# in #X_2#, #X_0# is never comfortable in his role as a criminal. He is unable to bear the psychological consequences of his atrocities.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s wife, a deeply ambitious woman who lusts for power and position. Early in the play, she seems to be the stronger and more ruthless of the two, as she urges her husband to kill #X_1# and seize the crown. After the bloodshed begins, however, #X_0# falls victim to guilt and madness to an even greater degree than her husband. Her conscience affects her to such an extent that she eventually commits suicide. Interestingly, she and #X_0# are presented as being deeply in love, and many of #X_0#’s speeches imply that her influence over her husband is primarily sexual. Their joint alienation from the world, occasioned by their partnership in crime, seems to strengthen the attachment that they feel to each another.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# “black and midnight hags” who plot mischief against #X_3# using charms, spells, and prophecies. #X_0#ir predictions prompt him to murder #X_2#, to order the deaths of #X_1# and his son, and to blindly believe in his own immortality. #X_0# play leaves the witches’ true identity unclear—aside from the fact that they are servants of #Y_0#, we know little about their place in the cosmos. In some ways, they resemble the mythological Fates, who impersonally weave the threads of human destiny. #X_0#y clearly take a perverse delight in using their knowledge of the future to toy with and destroy human beings.

-- #X_0# --
The brave, noble general whose children, according to the witches’ prophecy, will inherit the Scottish throne. Like #X_1#, #X_0# thinks ambitious thoughts, but he does not translate those thoughts into action. In a sense, #X_0#’s character stands as a rebuke to #X_1#, since he represents the path #X_1# chose not to take: a path in which ambition need not lead to betrayal and murder. Appropriately, then, it is #X_0#’s ghost—and not Duncan’s—that haunts #X_1#. In addition to embodying #X_1#’s guilt for killing #X_0#, the ghost also reminds #X_1# that he did not emulate #X_0#’s reaction to the witches’ prophecy.

-- #X_0# --
The good #X_0# of #Y_0# whom #X_1#, in his ambition for the crown, murders. #X_0# is the model of a virtuous, benevolent, and farsighted ruler. His death symbolizes the destruction of an order in #Y_0# that can be restored only when #X_0#’s line, in the person of #X_2#, once more occupies the throne.

-- #X_0# --
A Scottish nobleman hostile to #X_1#’s kingship from the start. He eventually becomes a leader of the crusade to unseat #X_1#. The crusade’s mission is to place the rightful king, #X_2#, on the throne, but #X_0# also desires vengeance for #X_1#’s murder of #X_0#’s wife and young son.

-- #X_0# --
The son of #X_2#, whose restoration to the throne signals #Y_1#’s return to order following #X_3#’s reign of terror. #X_0# becomes a serious challenge to #X_3# with #X_4#’s aid (and the support of #Y_0#). Prior to this, he appears weak and uncertain of his own power, as when he and #X_1# flee #Y_1# after their father’s murder.

-- #X_0# --
The goddess of witchcraft, who helps the three witches work their mischief on Macbeth.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s son, who survives #X_2#’s attempt to murder him. At the end of the play, #X_0#’s whereabouts are unknown. Presumably, he may come to rule #Y_0#, fulfilling the witches’ prophecy that #X_1#’s sons will sit on the Scottish throne.

-- #X_0# --
A Scottish nobleman.

-- #X_0# --
A Scottish nobleman.

-- #X_0# --
A group of ruffians conscripted by #X_3# to murder #X_1#, #X_2# (whom they fail to kill), and #X_4#’s wife and children.

-- #X_0# --
The drunken doorman of #X_1#’s castle.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s wife. The scene in her castle provides our only glimpse of a domestic realm other than that of #X_1# and #X_0# #X_1#. She and her home serve as contrasts to #X_0# #X_1# and the hellish world of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s son and #X_3#’s younger brother.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s protagonist, the Madame #X_0# of the title. A country girl educated in a convent and married to Charles #X_0# at a young age, she harbors idealistic romantic illusions, covets sophistication, sensuality, and passion, and lapses into fits of extreme boredom and depression when her life fails to match the sentimental novels she treasures. She has a daughter, #X_1#, but lacks maternal instincts and is often annoyed with the child. Occasionally, guilt or a memory of her simple childhood causes her to repent, and she becomes devoutly religious and dedicates herself to her husband and child. Such fits of conscience are short-lived. #X_0#’s desire for passion and pleasure leads her into extramarital affairs with #X_4# and #X_3#. In addition, she runs up enormous debts against her husband’s property and commits suicide when she realizes she will be unable to repay them.

-- #X_0# --
A country doctor, kind, but simple, dull, and unremarkable. #X_0# is a terrible doctor who manages simple cases decently but is incapable of performing difficult operations. For example, when he tries to operate on #X_2#’s leg, it develops gangrene and has to be removed. #X_0# dotes on his wife, #X_1#, who can do no wrong in his eyes. Only his mother holds as much sway over him as his wife, and even she loses control over him after his marriage. Despite his deep love for #X_1#, he doesn’t understand her. Her looks and dress captivate him, but he remains oblivious to her personality. His adoration of her often leads him to act with baffling innocence. He fails to detect her extramarital affairs with #X_4# and #X_3#, which are so poorly concealed that they become the subjects of town gossip. When #X_1# begins to run up debts, he grants her power of attorney over all his property, an act that leads to his financial ruin. After #X_1#’s suicide, he learns of her infidelities and, soon after, dies a broken man.

-- #X_0# --
The apothecary at #Y_0#; a pompous, self-impressed man of the bourgeois class who helps #X_3# become established as a doctor in the town. #X_0# is superficial and obnoxious. He loves to hear himself talk, and his lengthy commentaries are filled with clichés. His pomposity can cause real harm, as when he encourages #X_3# to operate on #X_6# to disastrous effect. An irreligious man, #X_0# often argues with #X_2#, the town priest, claiming that religion and prayer are useless. #X_0# is the perfect embodiment of all the bourgeois values and characteristics that so disgust #X_5# and bore his heroine, #X_4#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s friend in #Y_2#, who later becomes her lover. When #X_0# is a law clerk in #Y_2#, he shares many of #X_1#’s romantic preconceptions and her love for sentimental novels. He falls in love with her but moves away to #Y_0# to study law, partly because he considers their love impossible as long as she remains married. When #X_1# meets him later in #Y_1#, his time in the city has made him more sure of himself. He now perceives #X_1# to be unsophisticated and thinks he can win her love. Although #X_1# believes him to be cosmopolitan, #X_2# presents him as awkward and full of himself. Drawn to his newfound urban sophistication, #X_1# begins an affair with him. At first, they succeed in living up to one another’s romantic ideals. However, as the affair progresses, #X_1# and #X_0# grow increasingly bored and disgusted with one another. He cannot help her when she is in monetary distress and makes excuses for failing to help her financially. #X_0# marries shortly after #X_1#’s death.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s first lover, a wealthy landowner with an estate near #Y_0#. #X_0# is shrewd, selfish, and manipulative. He has had scores of lovers and believes #X_1# to be no more sincere than any of them. He plots his seduction of #X_1# with strategic precision, begins an affair with her, and then abandons her when he becomes bored of her romantic fancies and emotional demands.

-- #X_0# --
A sly, sinister merchant and moneylender in #Y_0# who leads #X_2# into debt, financial ruin, and eventually suicide by playing on her weakness for luxury and extravagance. #X_0# is a bit of a devil figure who tempts people with luxuries they can’t afford and knows just when to appear with his requests for money and promises of more loans.

-- #X_0# --
The town priest in #Y_0#, #X_0# tends to focus more on worldly matters than on spiritual ones. He often argues with #X_1# about the value of religion, but seems incapable of grasping deep spiritual problems.

-- #X_0# --
The crippled servant at the inn in #Y_0#. Under pressure from #X_2# and #X_3#, Charles attempts to operate on #X_0#’s club foot. The operation fails, gangrene sets in, and #X_0# loses his leg.

-- #X_0# --
Charles and #X_2#’s daughter, who is condemned to a life of poverty by her mother’s financial excesses and her parents’ deaths.

-- #X_0# --
The tax collector in #Y_1#. #X_0# takes his meals regularly at the #Y_0#. He is quiet, and amuses himself by making napkin rings on the lathe in his attic.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s first employer, the well-to-do lawyer in #Y_1#. When #X_1# seeks his help with her financial hardship, he offers his assistance in return for sexual favors—an offer she angrily declines.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father, a simple, essentially kindly farmer with a weakness for drink. He is devoted both to #X_2# and to the memory of his first wife, whom he loved deeply.

-- #X_0# --
An esteemed doctor from #Y_0# who is called in after #X_2# takes arsenic at the end of the novel. He is coldly analytical and condescending to his inferiors, but he is brilliant and competent, and he feels a real sympathy for his patients.

-- #X_0# --
A bitter, conservative woman who spoiled her son #X_1# as a youth and disapproves of his marriage to #X_2#. She sees through #X_2#’s lies and tries to get #X_1# to rein in his wife’s excessive spending, but she rarely succeeds.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s assistant. #X_0# is young, impressionable, and simple. He falls terribly in love with #X_1# and unwittingly gives her access to the arsenic that she uses to commit suicide.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s first wife. She realizes that #X_1# is enamored with #X_2#. Soon after having this realization, she dies from the shock of having all her property stolen by her lawyer.

-- #X_0# --
The novel's title character, #X_0# grows up amid abuse and poverty in the Bowery neighborhood of #Y_0# Lower East Side. Her mother, #X_3#, is a vicious alcoholic; her brother, #X_2#, is mean-spirited and brutish. But #X_0# grows up a beautiful young lady whose romantic hopes for a better life remain untarnished. Her seemingly inevitable path towards destruction begins when she becomes enamored of #X_4#, whose show of confidence and worldliness seems to promise wealth and culture. Seduced and abandoned by #X_4#, #X_0# becomes a neighborhood scandal when she turns to prostitution. #X_1# leaves her demise vague--she either commits suicide or is murdered. She seems a natural and hereditary victim, succumbing finally to the forces of poverty and social injustice that built up against her even before her birth. Like all the people in this short novel, she seems chiefly a type rather than an individuated character, serving to illustrate principles about modern urban life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s brother and #X_3#'s son, #X_0# Johnson is the first character we meet in the novel, and from the start he is fighting a street battle. He grows up violent and combative, hardened against sympathy and introspection. Although he himself has seduced and abandoned women, he fails to see himself in #X_4#, whom he hates for seducing #X_2#, and he cannot muster any sympathy for #X_2#, whom he blames, hypocritically, for bringing disgrace on the household. Unlike his naïve sister, #X_0# has the toughness necessary to survive in the rough world of urban poverty, but this toughness seems inseparable from the casual cruelty that seems endemic to the novel's world. He survives his sister, but one senses that he will only engender the same kind of cruelty and misery that his parents engendered in him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s and #X_1#'s mother, the alcoholic and vicious #X_0# Johnson is a virtual incarnation of the devil. She spends the novel shattering furniture and flying into uncontrollable rages; even in the rough-and-tumble #Y_0#, where we sense that drunkenness is hardly foreign, #X_0# is a neighborhood joke. After terrifying #X_2# into fleeing from home, #X_0# is hypocritical enough to condemn her daughter for immorality, and crassly sentimental enough to stage an elaborate scene of mourning for the daughter she never really loved.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_1#'s, #X_0# seduces and then abandons #X_2#. A bartender with bourgeois pretensions, #X_0# affects bravado and wealth; to the downtrodden #X_2#, he seems to promise a better life. But #X_0# is easily drawn away from #X_2# by the manipulative and relatively sophisticated #X_3#. He certainly seems the villain in #X_2#'s story, but it is important to remember that he is only the proximate cause of her tragedy; in #X_2#, tragedy is inevitable, and it waits only for human agents, of whom there are many readily available. And it is also true that #X_0# seems, as we first meet him, to be the product of the brutalizing atmosphere of the Bowery, shaped as much as #X_2# by his surroundings. Indeed, he, too, can be considered a victim of his environment, and we see at the end, when he is abandoned by #X_3#, that he, too, is an innocent despoiled by circumstance.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the "woman of brilliance and audacity" who, nearly effortlessly, lures #X_2# away from #X_1#. She promises the sophistication and worldliness that #X_2# craves, just as #X_2# represents the same things to #X_1#. In the novel's penultimate scene, it becomes clear that #X_0# has nothing but contempt for #X_2#, whom she is using for money. It seems from #X_1# that only tough women like #X_0# can survive male predation in the world of the Bowery.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s youngest brother and #X_2#'s son. Brought up amid the curses and flying cutlery of his parents' battles, #X_0# dies early in the novel.

-- #X_0# --
The father of #X_3#, #X_1#, and #X_5#, and #X_4#'s husband, Mr. #X_2# is known only by his last name, and dies early in the novel. In what little we see of him, he seems casually brutal to his children, even to the extent of stealing beer from his son #X_1#. Like his wife, he is an alcoholic, going to bars to escape the "livin' hell" of his home.

-- #X_0# --
A nameless #X_0# #X_0# who lives in the same tenement house as #X_1#'s family. She befriends the children to a degree, offering #X_1# shelter in her apartment after #X_1# has been rejected by #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# appears abruptly in the novel during the closing scene. She helps to whip #X_2# up into a sentimental fit of mourning for her lost daughter, #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A #Y_0# urchin who fights with #X_2# in the novel's first scene and who, like #X_2#, grows up to be a violent brawler. He is #X_2#'s ally in the fight against #X_3# late in the novel.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s older sister. #X_0# is in her early 30s. She has a more resentful attitude toward Madame, and in their fantasies maintains her role as a maid. She gets aroused by #X_1#'s (as Madame) sadistic abuse of her, but she is not afraid to fight back with violence. She also has a softer side—she often treats #X_1# with maternal affection, she was too cowardly to kill Madame when she had the chance, and she even privately delights in reading #X_1#'s fantastical stories. The maids have been planning to get #X_0# impregnated by #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s younger sister. #X_0# is in her early 30s. While she claims she loathes Madame, she is also quick to defend her, pointing out her kindness. Madame does favor #X_0#, and #X_0#, who always plays the role of Madame in her and #X_1#'s fantasies, wishes to attain her status. As #X_1# observes, she strolls around Madame's balcony at night as if she were royalty, and loves making herself up with Madame's cosmetics. She also writes fantastical stories, which #X_1# secretly reads and revels in.

-- #X_0# --
Employs #X_1# and #X_3# as her maids. #X_0# is a wealthy older woman whose husband has been anonymously "denounced" to the police. She lives a lavish lifestyle, wearing furs and drinking champagne, but in #X_2#'s absence she sometimes resigns herself to a self-pitying life of mourning. Still, she is aroused by his criminality and fantasizes about breaking him free from prison. She favors #X_1#, and is scared that the maids will desert her, too. She has occasional whims of generosity, but she often lashes out at the maids.

-- #X_0# --
The husband of Madame. #X_0# never appears on-stage—he has been wrongfully sent to prison by an anonymous letter from #X_1#—but his presence looms over the play. Though his character is not detailed too greatly, it is obvious that Madame is dependent on him, and the maids despise him as much as they do her.

-- #X_0# --
The milkman. #X_0# never appears on-stage, but #X_1# and #X_2# frequently bring him up in their insults. Their plan is for #X_2# to get impregnated by him, but he seems to be carrying on affairs with both sisters.

-- #X_0# --
The novel's main protagonist, from whose point of view nearly the entire story is told. Intelligent and vivacious, #X_0#Milford attends college in #Y_2# and then works as a librarian in #Y_5# for three years before marrying Dr. Will #X_3# and moving to #Y_1#. An incurable romantic, she yearns to bring beauty and culture to the ugly towns of the Middle West. Her failed attempts to reform #Y_1# provide the novel's main conflict. Unhappy with her life in #Y_1#, #X_0#seeks escape through books and a romantic friendship with a young man named #X_2#. In the end, however, the town defeats her. She leaves #Y_1# to move to #Y_6#, #Y_0#, but returns and accepts the town as it is. Throughout the novel, her marriage to #X_3# endures its ups and downs, although she continues to love and admire him. #X_4# loosely based #Y_1# on his own hometown of #Y_4#, #Y_3#, and the character of #X_0#on himself.

-- #X_0# --
The novel's secondary protagonist. Dr. #X_3# #X_0#provides a foil to his wife, #X_1#. While she also desires achieving social change and individual happiness, he feels satisfied with his life and prefers to maintain the status quo. While #X_1# is romantic and interested in the fine arts, #X_0#is realistic and materialistic, interested only in making money and taking care of his family and patients. #X_3# sets #X_1# on a pedestal and admires her, regardless of her whims. As they drift apart, however, he begins a short-lived secretive affair with #X_2#. When #X_1# moves to #Y_1#, #X_0#visits her and courts her a second time in order to persuade her to return to #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s high school teacher. #X_0# becomes one of #X_2#'s best friends, often serving as a buffer between #X_2# and #X_3#, as she understands both points of views. Because she once loved #X_6# herself, #X_0# develops a love-hate relationship with #X_2# and tries to become her adviser. While the two women share many interests, they gradually drift apart when #X_0# marries #X_5# and devotes herself to housework.

-- #X_0# --
Another important friend of #X_1#'s. #X_0# is an intelligent, middle-aged bachelor lawyer. Although #X_1# admires him briefly, she discovers, to her disappointment, that he maintains a defeatist attitude and feels quite content doing nothing important with his life. During an important conversation with #X_1#, #X_0# explains that he suffers from the "Village Virus," a disease that saps the will of ambitious people who live in small towns.

-- #X_0# --
A warm and friendly woman who becomes #X_2#'s maid and good friend. #X_0# also acts as another foil to #X_2#. Arriving in #Y_0# on the same day as #X_2#, #X_0# makes a very different assessment of #Y_0#, finding the town beautiful and exciting. #X_0# marries #X_3# and tragically dies.

-- #X_0# --
#Y_0#'s town handyman. #X_0#, who supports socialism and #Y_2#, is largely scorned by the citizens of #Y_0#, who consider him slightly insane. #X_3#, however, finds him to be a kindred spirit because she shares many of his liberal views. Although #X_0# settles down after his marriage to #X_2#, he leaves #Y_0# forever when his wife and son, #X_4#, die.

-- #X_0# --
A young tailor in his twenties who finds himself ridiculed by the townspeople because of his attractive feminine appearance and interest in books. #X_0# embarks on a romantic friendship with #X_1#, much to her delight, but leaves Gopher Prairie to avoid creating a scandal.

-- #X_0# --
The new high school teacher in town. #X_0#, who is physically active and intelligent, becomes #X_1#'s friend. She leaves town, however, when a student, #X_2#, falsely accuses her of corrupting him. #X_0#'s tragedy provides #X_3# with way to demonstrate and ridicule the hypocrisy of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A wealthy automobile manufacturer originally from #Y_0# who allegedly has attained nationwide fame. #X_0# is much admired by the people of the town, who admire material success. #X_1#, however, finds him coarse and overbearing. She admires #X_0# for his importance, but discovers in #Y_1# that in reality he is relatively unimportant.

-- #X_0# --
A rather spineless man who marries #X_1#. #X_0# becomes more courageous and upstanding, however, due to his wife's prodding. He enlists in World War I and comes back to #Y_0# a hero.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# and #X_2#'s infant son. #X_0#, who is named after #X_1#'s deceased father, is very much like his own unimaginative father, #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s nosy neighbor and the town's gossip. #X_0# is very much a religious hypocrite, creating a scandal out of nothing when her boarder, #X_3#, innocently attends a barn dance with her son, Cy #X_0#, the town's juvenile delinquent.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s relatives who move to #Y_0# and prove to be a constant source of annoyance to #X_2#. #X_0# #X_0# joins her friend, Mrs. #X_1#, as one of the town's biggest gossips.

-- #X_0# --
The wife of to Dave #X_0#, the town druggist. #X_0# is a neurotic hypochondriac with whom #X_3# begins a secretive affair as his relationship with #X_1# deteriorates.

-- #X_0# --
The great arms industrialist of Europe. #X_0# returns to his long abandoned family with to wreak havoc with his new gospel of man's salvation. He is a man of "formidable reserves of power, both bodily and mental, in his capacious chest and long head." His gentleness is that of a "strong man who has learnt by experience that his natural grip hurts ordinary people." #X_0# understands that he is a man who has bent the world to his will, and a man who determines the course of civilization and history.

-- #X_0# --
Robust, jolly, and energetic, #X_0#begins the play as a major for #Y_0#. She is peacefully convinced of her mission to redeem mankind. Her father's arrival will force her to recognize that the wealthy, rather than God, hold the world and its salvation in their hands. Undershaft underscores the "inspiration" that truly defines her as the savior of all. The daughter of a foundling, #X_0#ostensibly lacks social class and comes "straight from the heart of the whole people."

-- #X_0# --
A "slight, thin haired, and sweet voiced" student of #X_4#. #X_0# is determined to marry #X_3# and enthralled by the excesses and ecstasies of the Dionysian spirit. In his determination, he has joined her in #Y_1# to bring this spirit to the power, but ultimately converts to #X_6#'s gospel, becoming #X_2#'s heir at the #Y_0#. #X_5# describes #X_0# as a "determined, tenacious, intolerant person" who presents himself as he is, "considerate, gentle, explanatory, even mild and apologetic, capable possibly of murder, but not of cruelty or coarseness." It is not love that drives him to #X_3#, but an unmerciful "instinct."

-- #X_0# --
A "very typical managing matron of the upper class," a woman with "plenty of practical ability and worldly experience." Around fifty years old, she is "limited in the oddest way with domestic and class limitations." Upon #X_0#'s arrival, the family—and #X_3# in particular—will abandon her as she is too set in her ways to participate in the revolution he brings. #X_2# affectionately imagines her through a series of paradoxes: #X_0# #X_0# is at once well dressed and careless in her dress, well bred and reckless of her breeding, well-mannered and yet appallingly outspoken.

-- #X_0# --
Lady #X_2#'s only son. #X_0# is a "gravely correct young man" who takes himself and his sense of morality very seriously. He remains in some awe from his mother from "childish habit and bachelor shyness" but quickly comes to assert his majority in planning his future.

-- #X_0# --
A stereotypical "young man about town." #X_0# suffers from a "frivolous sense of humor which plunges him at the most inopportune moments into paroxysms of imperfectly suppressed laughter." A comic figure, he suffers the scolding of Lady #X_1# throughout the play for his tactlessness and inarticulate speech. He also repeatedly declares his allegiance to #Y_0# and other moral platitudes, though these declarations only mask his somewhat mercenary propensity to align himself with the wealthy. He is engaged to #X_2# on a lark.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s younger sister. #X_0# is a "slender, bored, and mundane" society girl. She is extraneous to the play.

-- #X_0# --
A young, unemployed, and opportunistic "poser." #X_0# appears incapable of honesty and altruism. He exemplifies the agile "humbugs" that take advantage of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
Already looking sixty at the age of forty-five, #X_0# is a "commonplace old bundle of poverty and hard-worn humanity." Like #X_1#, has embellished on her down-and-out condition to pander to the workers of the #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A "half hardened, half worn-out" old-timer. #X_0# has just lost his job to a younger laborer. He figures as the play's "honest poor man," weeping in shame over having to take a hand-out, pledging to get back on his feet, and abhorring the injustices of the wealthy.

-- #X_0# --
A "rough customer of about twenty-five" who appears at the #Y_0# shelter to reclaim his converted girlfriend and bully its staff. #X_0# speaks a thick Cockney accent that #X_2# marks as "horribly debased" when at its worst. The swaggering, menacing #X_0# is quickly cowed and disgraced by the shining Major #X_1#. Indeed, if not for her father's intervention, #X_1# would have won his soul through his devastating humiliation.

-- #X_0# --
An overwrought "Salvation lass" who earnestly believes in her cause and her patron, Major #X_1#. She suffers an assault from #X_2# in Act II.

-- #X_0# --
A Salvation #Y_0# Commissioner. #X_0# is an "earnest looking" middle-aged woman with a "caressing, urgent voice" and an "appealing manner." By accepting the donations of the wealthy as necessary to the work of salvation, she surrenders the #Y_0# to millionaires like #X_1# and #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A foreman at Undershaft's armory.

-- #X_0# --
The longtime family butler who hesitantly announces #X_1#'s return to the household.

-- #X_0# --
An extraordinarily gifted five-year-old girl who is the book’s protagonist. #X_0# lives with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. #X_2#, and older brother #X_1#. She excels at reading and math and is strikingly unassuming and humble given her brilliance. She has a strong moral code and is acutely attuned to right versus wrong and the injustice of being accused of something she hasn’t done. She is a good judge of a person’s character and what is fair and just.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s teacher. Her students love and adore her. #X_0# recognizes #X_1#’s brilliance. She becomes #X_1#’s ally, and advocates for #X_1# when she visits the #X_3#’ home. She tells the story of her childhood to #X_1#, revealing the cruelty she has endured living with #X_0# #X_2#, who is her aunt. In the end, #X_0# convinces the #X_3# that she will care for #X_1# as her own child.

-- #X_0# --
The headmistress of the school. She is a physically imposing woman, violent, and cruel. Her educational philosophy is one based on punishment rather than reward. Despite this, the children at the school, including #X_1#, stand up to her. #X_0#’s persona crumbles when #X_1# reveals the evils of her past.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father and a crooked used-car salesman. He is cruel toward #X_2# and considers her “nothing more than a scab,” to be picked and flung away. #X_2#’s brilliance serves to spotlight his own stupidity. Her honesty and sense of fairness highlight his crookedness and dishonesty.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s classmate and friend. She is brave and develops a rebellious spirit like #X_2# and #X_1#, a senior class student. She is clever, as evidenced when she puts the newt in Miss #X_3#’s water jug.

-- #X_0# --
The librarian who initially encourages #X_1# to read children’s books. She eventually recognizes #X_1#’s ability, sets her up with a library card, and recommends adult books for her to read, beginning with Great Expectations.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother. She fails to recognize #X_1#’s brilliance, and is more interested in playing Bingo every afternoon, heating up TV dinners for her family, and watching television. She laughs with #X_1# and ridicules her husband in the hair dye scene without realizing it was #X_1#’s prank.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s older brother. Though older than #X_2#, he is not nearly as bright. His father wants him to take over the used car business one day.

-- #X_0# --
A senior girl at the school. She tells #X_2# and #X_3# stories about Miss #X_4# and, with the other students, tries to stand up against the headmistress’s cruelty.

-- #X_0# --
An overweight boy in #X_1#’s class who becomes the object of Miss #X_2#’s cruelty. When Miss #X_2# wants to force him to eat a whole cake, believing that he can’t, he proves her wrong. After he finishes the cake and the class explodes in celebration, Miss #X_2# explodes in rage. He is a hero for standing up to her.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the play. #X_0#’s historical refusal to swear to #Y_0#’s Act of Supremacy is the play’s main subject, but #X_2# intentionally does not depict #X_0# as the saint or martyr of legend. #X_2# does not see #X_0# as a person who takes a stand and sacrifices himself for a cause. Rather, #X_2#’s #X_0# is a man who gives up his life because he cannot sacrifice his own commitment to his conscience, which dictates that he not turn his back on what he believes is right or on #X_4#. To #X_0#, a man’s conscience is his self, so he refuses to betray his own conscience even on pain of death. Significantly, #X_0# makes no move to speak out against King #X_5#’s divorce or to make any public gesture that indicates his opinion on the matter. Only after #X_3# condemns him does #X_0# reveal his true opinions.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# sporadically narrates the play, and he plays the roles of most of the lower-class characters: #X_4#’s steward #X_3#, the boatman, the publican (innkeeper), the jailer, the jury foreman, and the headsman (executioner). #X_2# explains in his preface that he intends the #X_0# #X_0# to personify attitudes and actions that are common to everyone, but ultimately the #X_0# #X_0# shows that by common, #X_2# implies base. In most instances, the #X_0# #X_0# plays characters who just do their jobs without thinking about the consequences of their actions or anyone’s interest other than their own. #X_0#refore, most of these characters end up betraying their own personal moral values. Over the course of the play, the characters the #X_0# #X_0# plays become more and more guilt-ridden. In the end, the #X_0# #X_0# silences his guilty conscience by finding solace in the fact that he is alive. He ends the play by implying that most people do the same thing.

-- #X_0# --
A low-level functionary whom #X_3# helped establish. #X_0# seeks to gain employment, but #X_3# denies him a high-ranking position and suggests that #X_0# become a teacher. #X_0#, however, goes to work for #Y_0# instead and eventually obtains from #X_2# a post as the attorney general for #Y_1# in exchange for perjuring himself at #X_3#’s trial. Like #X_5#, #X_0# serves as a foil, or character contrast, for Sir #X_4#. In particular, #X_0#’s meteoric rise to wealth and power is simultaneous with #X_3#’s fall from favor. Unlike #X_3#, #X_0# conquers and destroys his conscience rather than obeying it. The repetition of the word rich in his name signals #X_0#’s Machiavellian willingness to sacrifice his moral standards for wealth and status.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s close friend. #X_0# is ultimately asked by #X_1#, and even encouraged by #X_2# himself, to betray his friendship with #X_2#. A large and rather simpleminded man, he is often too stupid to know what’s going on, and he is innocent relative to #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s wife. A conflicted character, #X_0# spends most of the play questioning why her husband refuses to give in to the king’s wishes. Her attitude shifts from anger to confusion. Eventually, #X_0# shows her that he cannot go to his death until he knows that she understands his decision. When she visits her husband in prison, #X_0# finally shows him unconditional love, saying that the fact that “God knows why” #X_0# must die is good enough for her.

-- #X_0# --
A crafty lawyer who is the primary agent plotting against #X_1#. Whereas #X_2# and the Common Man are driven to their immoral actions (conspiracy, execution, and so on) somewhat reluctantly at times, #X_0# is motivated more by an evil nature. He facilitates #X_1#’s downfall with only a minimum  of guilt.

-- #X_0# --
The Lord Chancellor of #Y_0#, who dies suddenly following his inability to obtain a dispensation from the pope that would annul King Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon and permit him to marry #X_1#. Though #X_2#’s character descriptions claim #X_0# is ambitious and intelligent, #X_0#’s character is not well developed, and his primary function relates to the plot. #X_0#’s sudden death hangs over the rest of the play as a warning to anyone who would court the king’s disapproval.

-- #X_0# --
The Spanish ambassador to #Y_0#. #X_0# is loyal to his country and intent on assuring that the divorce between King #X_2# and #X_1#, which would dishonor #X_1#, does not go through. When questioning #X_3#, #X_0# displays his aptitude for hiding his political agenda under the guise of religious fervor.

-- #X_0# --
An overzealous young man who is a staunch Lutheran at the beginning of the play and later converts to Catholicism. #X_0# is also #X_1#’s boyfriend and, after he converts to Catholicism, her husband. #X_0#’s high-minded ideals contrast with #X_2#’s level-headed morality, making #X_0# yet another foil for #X_2#. Each of #X_0#’s scenes shows him taking a public stance on a new issue, in opposition to #X_2#, who prefers to keep his opinions to himself. In a conversation with #X_0#, #X_2# argues that high-minded ideals, which he dubs “seagoing principles” are inconsistent at best, and he advocates human law as a better guide to morality.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s well-educated and inquisitive daughter. Also called #X_1#, #X_0# is in love with and later marries William #X_0#. She shows that she understands her father perhaps better than anyone else in the play (except for #X_2# himself, of course). However, like her mother, #X_0# questions her father’s actions.

-- #X_0# --
The king of #Y_0#, who only briefly appears onstage but is a constant presence in the speech and the thoughts of the other characters. It is very important to #X_0# that others think of him as a moral person, and he therefore cares greatly about what #X_2#, a man of great moral repute, thinks of him. #X_0#, who believes that he can force everyone, including the pope, into validating his desires, wants to put his conscience at ease by forcing #X_2# to sanction the king’s divorce from #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist. The daughter of a drunken sailor and a woman who married beneath her, she comes to live with her wealthy uncle and aunt, Sir #X_5# and Lady #X_1#. They take her in as an act of charity to her parents. She is mistreated and always reminded of her "place" as a charity ward, but she eventually comes to be an indispensable member of the family. Modest, always proper, and, as she grows older, quite beautiful, #X_0# is secretly in love with the #X_1#s' son #X_3# but is the subject of proposals by the slick #X_4#.

-- #X_0# --
A wealthy landowner and #X_1#'s uncle. He is authoritarian and rather hard on his children until a series of disasters show him the error of his ways. He owns slaves on his plantations in the Caribbean, a fact that hangs over the book. He means well and eventually does right by #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s aunt; her mother's sister and Sir #X_3#'s wife. She is neurotic, a hypochondriac, and lazy. A beauty in her youth, she values people's attractiveness over all else, yet she is honest enough to admit how much #X_2# means to her.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0#s' younger son. Since he will not be the heir to #Y_0#, he will become a clergyman. The only one of the #X_0#s' children with a good head and a good heart, #X_0# is #X_2#'s closest companion. He rather blindly falls in love with #X_3#, which almost leads to his downfall.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0#s' older daughter. Vain and pretentious, she abuses #X_3# and marries the odious #X_6# for his fortune. Her self-indulgence eventually gets her in quite a lot of trouble. Her name would have been pronounced "#X_0#h" (as in #X_0#h Carey).

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0#s' younger daughter. She is equally vain but slightly less cocky, since she is younger and less beautiful than #X_3#. She follows #X_3# around, and, upon #X_3#'s elopement, she runs away with #X_5#, her brother #X_4#'s friend.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0#s' older son and the heir to #Y_0#. He lives to party and has gotten into debt, for which #X_2# will suffer. Eventually, his lifestyle catches up to him, as he nearly dies from an illness caused by too much drinking.

-- #X_0# --
Sister to #X_3#'s mother and Lady #X_2#; wife of the first parson at #Y_0#. She has no children of her own and is an officious busybody, always trying to derive glory from her association with the family. She is horribly cruel to #X_3#, whom she is always reminding of her "place" in the family.

-- #X_0# --
Sister of Mrs. #X_3#, who is the wife of the second parson at #Y_0#. She is beautiful and charming, but also shallow and evil. She has been brought up poorly by an aunt and uncle and has been subject to the influences of her fashionable friends. She becomes friends with a reluctant #X_2#, while #X_1# falls in love with and nearly proposes to her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_5#'s brother. He is equally charming and possibly even more amoral, and he possesses a sizeable estate. First #X_4# and #X_3# fall in love with him, and he takes to #X_4#, despite her engagement. When #X_4# marries and the sisters leave #Y_0#, he falls for #X_2# and proposes to her. Everyone is convinced he is a changed man. Eventually, he meets up with #X_4# again, and the two run off, but their relationship ends badly.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s brother. Sir #X_4# has gotten him a commission in the #Y_0#, and #X_3# gets him a promotion as part of his effort to seduce #X_2#. #X_0# and #X_2# are extremely close, and he impresses everyone as a bright, capable young man. He represents a sort of ideal companion for #X_2#, although, as her brother, of course, he is not an eligible mate for her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s fiance and then husband. He is an idiot and a bore, but quite wealthy. It is his estate that the group visits early in the novel. He provides some comic relief with his stupid comments.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s younger sister, with whom she gets reacquainted when she returns to her family's home. #X_0# is a diamond in the rough, a smart girl with essentially good manners who is stuck in a terrible home. #X_2# brings her back to #Y_0# with her, where she becomes a new favorite of Sir #X_3# and Lady #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4# friend, who proposes the amateur theatricals at #Y_1#. He shows an interest in #X_2#, which continues in #Y_0#. After #X_3# runs off with #X_1#, #X_2# and #X_0# elope and marry; they, however, are rehabilitated within the family.

-- #X_0# --
The adolescent protagonist of the story. #X_0# works on a plantation plowing fields during his summer break from school. Not quite a child but not yet a man, seventeen-year-old #X_0# struggles to win respect from the other fieldworkers even though he lacks the requisite maturity. Experiencing the turmoil and restlessness of adolescence, he grows resentful of his powerlessness and thinks that owning a gun will instantly make him a man.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother. Beneath #X_0#’s steely exterior lies a practical, upstanding woman caught between making her son #X_1# happy and doing what she knows is right. She suspects that buying a gun will bring trouble but can’t refuse #X_1#. She is the first to realize that #X_2# died from a gunshot wound and forces #X_1# to tell the truth, even though she tries to downplay her own complicity.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s boss and the owner of a local plantation. Even though #X_0# seems to be a reasonable and fair employer, #X_1# still resents his authority on the plantation and in the community.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s father. A strict disciplinarian, #X_0# seems more interested in #X_1#’s earning potential and keeping good relations with #X_0# #X_2# than in his son’s happiness. He doesn’t mind using violence to maintain discipline at home.

-- #X_0# --
The local store’s owner and shopkeeper. Amiable and plump, #X_0# lends the mail-order catalog to #X_1#, even though he thinks #X_1# is too young to own a gun. Still, he brushes aside his doubts and offers to sell #X_1# an old pistol that he has in stock for only $2.

-- Dad --
The father of the family featured in this story is quiet, warm, and eager to start a completely new life on Mars. He burns a map of Earth, symbolizing his willingness to forget a past life. He is a former governor of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_1#'s eldest son; he seems to be around thirteen years old. He takes his responsibility as example-setter to his younger brothers very seriously. He understands that there is something "strange" about this picnic on Mars, and he is automatically willing to help his father make it easier for his brothers.

-- #X_0# --
As the novel’s protagonist, #X_0# is the “Man of Character” to whom the subtitle of The Mayor of #Y_0# alludes. When the novel opens, #X_0# is a disconsolate twenty-one-year-old hay-trusser who, in a drunken rage, sells his wife and daughter at a county fair. Eighteen years later, #X_0# has risen to become the mayor and the most accomplished corn merchant in the town of #Y_0#. Although he tries to atone for his youthful crimes, he focuses too much on his past misdeeds and enters a downward trajectory that embroils him in a fierce competition with a popular Scotchman named #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of #X_3# and #X_0#. #X_0# bears the same name as the child born to #X_3# and #X_2#, who actually dies shortly after #X_2# sells #X_3# and his daughter.

Though she experiences much hardship over the course of the novel, she maintains an even temperament throughout.

-- #X_0# --
The Scotchman who arrives in #Y_0# at the same time as Susan #X_2# and #X_1#. #X_0#’s business efficiency, good humor, and polish make him extremely popular among the town’s citizens. These same qualities, however, eventually make him #X_2#’s rival. Despite this tension in their friendship, #X_0# remains fair-minded, patient, and even kind in his dealings with the ruined #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A woman whom #X_2# meets, courts, and proposes to marry. #X_0# bucks convention, choosing to love whom she pleases when she pleases. Like #X_2#, she is guided by her emotions, and her reactions are thus not always rational.

-- #X_0# --
The man #X_2# intends to hire as his assistant before meeting #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
One of the workers in #X_2#’s hay-yard. #X_0# is also the source of the first disagreement between #X_2# and #X_1#, as #X_1# thinks that #X_2# is too rough with #X_0# when he is constantly late for work.

A peasant in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A teenage boy and the story’s main protagonist. Though frightened and confused by the strange surroundings of the Glade, #X_0# is inquisitive and quick-witted. He often rejects authority, and he shows disdain for the condescending “#X_1#” label he earns on his arrival. #X_0# demonstrates caring, loyalty, and a feeling of responsibility for those around him, even when he doesn’t understand it. He also proves to be both courageous and impulsive. His qualities and heroic acts quickly earn him both friends and adversaries. Though many Gladers treat #X_0# with suspicion, he strives to be judged based on his present actions, and not on his unknown past.

-- #X_0# --
A teenage girl and sole female resident of the Glade. At first unconscious and known only as “the girl,” the #X_1# are struck by her incredible beauty, noting her fair skin, dark hair, and blue eyes. Once #X_0# regains consciousness, she demonstrates strength, intelligence, confidence, and fearlessness. #X_0# shares a telepathic connection with #X_2#, as well as a past neither remembers. She is often a target of suspicion, though she proves herself to be trustworthy.

-- #X_0# --
An awkward, chubby #X_1# around age 12 or 13. #X_0# serves as the “Greenie” before #X_2# arrives. #X_0# is #X_2#’s first real friend in the #Y_0#, though he becomes more like a younger brother to the older boy. #X_0# is often silly, which annoys some of the #X_1#s, though his vulnerability is endearing to #X_2#. As a Slopper who’s full of false bravado and motivated by a desire to fit in, many of the #X_1#s underestimate #X_0#, though he ultimately shows that he is loyal and brave.

-- #X_0# --
The leader of the Gladers. As the oldest Glader and one of the first group to arrive, #X_0# has more experience than the other boys. His attempts to maintain order at all costs often portray him as mean or harsh, though he sometimes jokes and allows himself to be vulnerable. His appearance, with a short, cropped haircut and a clean-shaven face, also reflect his need for order.

-- #X_0# --
A former Runner who serves as second-in-command after he is injured in the Maze. Tall and muscular with long, blond hair, #X_0# is #X_2#’s closest and most trusted ally. Like #X_2#, #X_0# believes in order. He is kind, friendly, and trustworthy, motivated by his care for the Glade’s residents. His intelligence and fairness help him step up to lead when circumstances call for his authority.

-- #X_0# --
The Keeper of the Runners. #X_0# is fast, both mentally and physically. He is also smart and strong-minded. #X_0# acts based on his deep knowledge of the Maze, which makes him an ideal guide and mentor for #X_3#. #X_0# trusts his intuition, which sometimes leads to dangerous situations. However, he learns from his mistakes and ultimately believes in following the rules. #X_0# has a sarcastic sense of humor and sometimes demonstrates a quick temper. He is a trusted and loyal friend to #X_3# and #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The Keeper of the Builders. #X_0# is a loudmouthed bully. As the main antagonist, he makes no secret of his dislike and distrust for #X_2#. #X_0# is described as physically unattractive, with a disgusting nose, missing teeth, and stomach-turning breath. In spite of his bullheaded demeanor, #X_0# cares about the safety of the Glade, which is why he is a stickler for rules.

-- #X_0# --
A Builder who has been Stung by a Griever. The attack has altered #X_0#’s former personality and left him mentally unstable and prone to physical violence. He is also thin and pale, with veins pulsing through his skin. Though once a key #X_2#, he is now violent and unreliable.

-- #X_0# --
The main character, #X_0#, is a very virtuous and chaste young woman who faces a difficult decision when her brother is sentenced to death for fornication (unlawful sex). #X_0# does not approve of her brother's actions at all, but she pleads for his life out of loyalty and sisterly devotion. #X_0# is a spiritual person who starts off wanting to become a nun.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# other central figure is the #X_0#, who spends most of his time dressed as a friar in order to observe what is happening in his absence. #X_0#is unfailingly virtuous, good, and kind-hearted. He tends to rule a little softly, which is why he enlists #X_1#'s help.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s brother #X_0# is a young man sentenced to death for impregnating an unmarried woman. He was engaged to her by a common-law agreement, but they had sexual intercourse before the legal marriage took place. #X_0# depends less on the guidance of laws and religious practices than on his sister.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the villain of the play, a man who rules strictly and without mercy. He has his own weaknesses, however, and he is loathsome more for his hypocrisy than for anything else. He presents #X_1# with a difficult proposition and then does not even hold up his end of the bargain.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a wise lord who advises #X_1# to be more merciful. He is loyal to the Duke and seeks to carry out his orders justly, but cannot go against #X_1#'s will.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, described by #X_2# as a "fantastic," is a flamboyant bachelor who provides much of the play's comedic content. He is a friend of #X_1#'s and tries to help him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# was supposed to marry #X_1#, but he called the wedding off when she lost her dowry in a shipwreck that killed her brother.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# runs a brothel in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a clown who also works for Mistress #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The provost runs the prison and is responsible for carrying out all of #X_1#'s orders.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a dim-witted constable who arrests people for misconduct, particularly of the sexual variety. He speaks in malapropisms and provides comic-relief throughout the play.

-- #X_0# --
A long-term prisoner in the jail, #X_0# is sentenced to be executed together with #X_1#. The Duke originally considers him hopeless and therefore dispensable but later changes his mind.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s lover, she is pregnant with his baby.

-- #X_0# --
Protagonist of the play, #X_0#'s homeland is Colchis, an island in the Black Sea, which the Greeks considered the edge of the earth--a territory of barbarians. A sorceress and a princess, she used her powers and influence to help #X_2# secure #Y_0#; then, having fallen in love with him, she fled her country and family to live with #X_2# in Iolcus, his own home. During the escape across the Mediterranean, she killed her brother and dumped him overboard, so that her pursuers would have to slow down and bury him. While in Iolcus, she again used her devilish cleverness to manipulate the daughters of the local king and rival, Pelias, into murdering their own father. Exiled as murderers, #X_2# and #X_0# settled in Corinth, the setting of #X_1#' play, where they established a family of two children and gained a favorable reputation. All this precedes the action of the play, which opens with #X_2# having divorced #X_0# and taken up with a new family. The play charts #X_0#'s emotional transformation, a progression from suicidal despair to sadistic fury. She eventually avenges #X_2#'s betrayal with a series of murders, concluding with the deaths of her own children. Famously, the pleasure of watching #X_2# suffer their loss outweighed her own remorse at killing them.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# can be considered the play's villain, though his evil stems more from weakness than strength. A former adventurer, he abandons his wife, #X_3#, in order to marry #X_2#, the beautiful young daughter of #X_1#, King of Corinth. Hoping to advance his station through this second marriage, he only fuels #X_3# to a revenge that includes the deaths of his new bride, her father, and his children. #X_0#'s tactless self-interest and whiny rationalizations of his own actions make him a weak, unsympathetic character.

-- #X_0# --
The offspring of Jason and #X_1#, the children are presented as naïve and oblivious to the intrigue that surrounds them. #X_1# uses them as pawns in the murder of Glauce and Creon, and then kills them in the play's culminating horror. Their innocent deaths provide the greatest element of pathos--the tragic emotion of pity--in the play.

-- #X_0# --
Composed of the women of Corinth, the chorus chiefly serves as a commentator to the action, although it occasionally engages directly in the dialogue. The chorus members fully sympathize with Medea's plight, excepting her eventual decision to murder her own children.

-- #X_0# --
The King of Corinth, #X_0# banishes Medea from the city. Although a minor character, #X_0#'s suicidal embrace of his dying daughter provides one of the play's most dramatic moments, and his sentence against Medea lends an urgency to her plans for revenge.

-- #X_0# --
Daughter of Creon, #X_0# is the young, beautiful princess for whom Jason abandons Medea. Her acceptance of the poisoned coronet and dress as "gifts" leads to the first murder of the play. Although she never utters a word, #X_0#'s presence is constantly felt as an object of Medea's jealousy. (#X_0# is also referred to as Creusa.)

-- #X_0# --
The King of Athens, #X_0# passes through Corinth after having visited the Oracle at Delphi, where he sought a cure for his sterility. Medea offers him some fertility-inducing drugs in exchange for sanctuary in Athens. His appearance marks a turning point in the play, for Medea moves from being a passive victim to an aggressor after she secures his promise of sanctuary.

-- #X_0# --
The messenger appears only once in the play--he relates in gruesome, vivid detail the death scenes of #X_2# and #X_1#, which occur offstage.

-- #X_0# --
Caretaker of the house, the nurse of the children serves as #X_1#'s confidant. Her presence is mainly felt in the play's opening lament and in a few speeches addressing diverse subjects not entirely related to the action of the play.

-- #X_0# --
A very minor character, the tutor of the children mainly acts as a messenger, as well as the person responsible for shuffling the children around from place to place.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of #X_2# and Alice #X_0#, and the protagonist of the story. #X_0# was a peasant, and her actions were exceptionally well documented in the courts of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The wife of #X_4# and mother of #X_2#. #X_0# bore eight children, six of whom lived to adulthood. She seems to have been a dedicated mother, given her high success rate of healthy children. After #X_4# died in 1318, #X_0# provided for her youngest daughter, #X_1#, by marrying her off to #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s oldest brother and a wealthy landholder. #X_0# never married, but he did father an illegitimate daughter, Alice #X_0#I. In 1336, he combined resources and households with #X_3#. Prior to his death in 1340, he bequeathed his lands to Alice #X_0#I.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s older brother and a wealthy and important landholder. Like #X_1#, #X_0# never married, though he did father an illegitimate son to whom he willed his lands upon his death. As an adult, #X_0# lived next door to #X_1#, sharing a wall of his house with her. Also, he was unique among peasants insofar as he was educated and served officially as a cleric in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
Ruler of #Y_0# from 1272 to 1307. An unusually strong monarch, #X_0# #X_0# ruled during a crucial epoch in the development of English law, witnessing the institution of parliamentary custom, common law, and codified property laws. #X_0#n his last thirteen years, however, the state of #Y_0# worsened as #X_0# #X_0# harshly taxed and drafted his subjects for his campaigns against the French and his attempted subjugation of #Y_1#, whose resistance was led by #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The son of #X_0# I and ruler of #Y_0# from 1307 to 1327. Historians generally agree that #X_0# #X_0# was an eccentric and perhaps the most inept king ever to sit on the throne. He was temporarily the owner of #X_2# manor.

-- #X_0# --
The son of #X_0# II and ruler of #Y_1# from 1327 to 1377. An able king, #X_0# #X_0# began a series of campaigns against the French, which later became known as the Hundred Years’ War. In order to finance this war, #X_0# #X_0# heavily taxed the country. For a time, he was the owner of #Y_0# manor.

#X_1#’s nephew and the son of Henry #X_0#. After #X_1#’s death, #X_0# claimed inheritance for #X_1#’s lands but was denied in favor of #X_1#’s sister #X_2#. Promptly following this decision, #X_0# received half of the lands in dispute from #X_2#, which suggested that he and #X_2# reached an informal agreement.

#X_0#is the unnamed narrator of "#X_2# the Scrivener." He owns a law firm on Wall Street, and he employs four men as scriveners, or copyists: #X_5#, #X_4#, #X_3#, and #X_2#. #X_0#is about sixty years old. He is level-headed, industrious, and has a good mind for business. He is good at dealing with people, at least until he meets #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a young man hired by the Lawyer to serve as a scrivener, or law- copyist. He starts out as an excellent copyist, but when asked to examine his work for errors, he replies that he "would prefer not to." #X_0# soon answers anything he is asked to do with "I would prefer not to," and he slowly drives the Lawyer and his fellow scriveners crazy.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the eldest employee of the Lawyer in "Bartleby the Scrivener." He is a good worker in the morning, but in the afternoon his face becomes flush and he gets a short temper. He makes more mistakes in his work in the afternoon.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is another scrivener, or law-copyist, employed by the Lawyer in "Bartleby the Scrivener." #X_1# is the opposite of his fellow scrivener #Y_0#; #X_1# is young, and he works best in the afternoon. In the morning, he is troubled by stomach problems and a constant need to adjust the height of his desk.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the the Lawyer's errand boy in "#X_1# the Scrivener." His name comes from the fact that #Y_1#, #Y_0#, and #X_1# often send him to get ginger nut cakes.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is the "#X_1# widow" in "Sketch Eight" of "The Encantadas or Enchanted Isles." She was left on an island along with her husband and her brother for several months by a French whaler. Her husband and she had planned to enjoy their honeymoon on the tropical island. Instead, her husband and brother were killed in a boating accident, leaving #X_0#to fend for herself until the narrator's ship arrived.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#'s story is told in "Sketch Nine" of "The Encantadas." He deserted his ship and became a hermit on #X_1#'s Isle, where he kept a small hut and grew vegetables that he sold to passing ships. He eventually began to desire lordship over other people and kidnapped several sailors. Finally he stole a small boat from a passing ship and used it to return to the mainland, where he was arrested and thrown in jail.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is the main character of "Benito Cereno." He is the captain of the Bachelor's Delight, a whaling ship from #Y_0#. #X_0# is a pleasant, good-natured man, slow to become suspicious, but he is not naive.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is the character after whom the story is named. He is a tall, thin man. He is Chilean, and primarily speaks Spanish, though he knows some English. He is the captain of the San Dominick, a merchant vessel.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the leader of the slaves in "Benito #X_2#." #X_0# led the slave revolt against the sailors, taking over the San Dominick. For most of "Benito #X_2#," #X_0# masquerades as #X_2#'s servant. However, he is actually there to keep an eye on #X_2# and to make sure that #X_2# doesn't betray #X_0# and the slaves to Captain #X_3#. #X_0# is small, but he is wily and intelligent.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_1#'s main co-conspirator in "#X_2#." He is a huge black slave, tall and muscular, and he uses his size and strength to intimidate and threaten #X_2# throughout the story.

-- #X_0# --
The owner of the slaves on #Y_0#, and a friend of #X_2#. #X_0#'s death is ordered by #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The novella's protagonist. #X_0#is a precocious and gregarious twelve year-old girl in the throes of adolescence. She is in a state of limbo between the innocent, sheltered days of her childhood, and the more worldliness of young adulthood. As a result of this rift, she is disconnected from everyone around her and spends the novella searching for a way to meld with other people. She has lofty fantasies about how she will escape what she feels is a stifling existence. And she is stubborn and contentious with anyone who might stand in her way. However, her naïveté and lack of awareness of the adult world, particularly when it comes to matters of sex and interpersonal relationships, hold her back from achieving her fantastical plans. In each of the three parts of the novella, she goes by three different names: first #X_0#, then #X_2#, and then #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_2# family's African-American housekeeper. Though she is over forty years old, she is still an avidly sexual woman who is never shy about having a good time with the various men who come through her life. In fact, by the end of the novella, she considers marrying her fifth husband. She is a no-nonsense type who doesn't put up with #X_3#'s difficult and moody behavior. She acts as a voice of reason, giving readers some better perceptive on the reality that #X_3# easily overlooks.

-- #X_0# --
The six year-old first cousin of #X_2# who spends much his time hanging around the #X_1# house. Intelligent beyond his years and highly circumspect, he is quick with an insightful comment. He acts as a foil for #X_2#, representing the childhood she wants so badly to leave behind. Also, his calm demeanor contrasts her often hysterical behavior. #X_0# #X_0#'s sudden death from meningitis at the end of the novel represents the death of #X_2#'s childhood, as if he only ever existed as a metaphor.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s quiet and serious widower. Mr. #X_0#' wife, #X_2#'s mother, died when #X_2# was born. His function in the novel is minimal, as he spends most of the novel out of frame, working in his jewelry shop. When we do hear from him, it is as a stern adult voice, one that keeps the cantankerous #X_2# in line.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0#, who is never given a name, is in town on leave for three days. He is a sullen, quiet type who seems to have one thing on his mind: sex. He represents the harshness of the adult world, opening #X_1#'s eyes, both in to the dangers of war and of sexuality.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s older brother who gets married to #X_3#. A completely absent figure from the immediate action, he becomes the source of all #X_2#'s desires and fantasies. She spent two years dreaming about him while he was stationed in #Y_0#, and now all she can think about is somehow joining in on his marriage. However hard #X_2# tries to convince herself that she is an adult, #X_0# still sees her as a little kid.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s fiancée from #Y_0#. We are given only the smallest glimpse of her, and then only in flashbacks. Like #X_3#, she represents #X_2#'s great wish to become and adult and connect with other people.

-- #X_0# --
In the summer previous to the novella's action, #X_1# and #X_0# "committed a queer sin" in #X_0#'s garage. We can safely assume they were kissing, though #X_2# is vague. #X_1#'s reaction to the experience with #X_0# tells us how she is both ignorant and afraid of matters regarding sex.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# great-uncle, who is not related to #X_1# by blood. After a long illness, he dies on Saturday. This is much to the irritation of #X_1#, who feels the glum nature of death distracts from the excitement about the wedding.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s only friend until she moved away to #Y_0#, leaving #X_1# alone.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s foster brother. #X_0# seems to have a few screws loose. He is unable to go to war, so he lives with Big Mama. He is a lighted skinned African- American and represents someone who might be able to change their racial identity in the same way that #X_3# might otherwise change herself from an androgynous child to a feminine adult.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s latest beau, who is well off and works in a restaurant. He and #X_1# eventually agree to marry.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s first husband, who died in 1931, at the same time when #X_2# was born.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s mother. #X_0# is something of a shoddy fortune teller. She tells #X_2# her fortune, and does not give #X_2# the rosy future #X_2# had hoped. However, she turns out to be correct, putting #X_2# into her place yet again.

-- #X_0# --
Former boarders in the #X_1# household. #X_2# once caught them doing what we can assume was having sex. This scenario shows us how completely ignorant #X_2# is about matters of sex.

-- #X_0# --
Becomes a new friend to #X_1# shortly after the main events of the novella. Two years older than #X_1#, she is mature enough to satisfy #X_1#'s desire to grow up, but close enough to #X_1#'s age that the two of them can realistically connect emotionally.

-- #X_0# --
At the end of the novella, #X_1# and her father get ready to move into a suburb house with #X_0# #X_0# and #X_0# #X_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A Jewish moneylender in #Y_0#. Angered by his mistreatment at the hands of #Y_0#’s Christians, particularly #X_1#, #X_0# schemes to eke out his revenge by ruthlessly demanding as payment a pound of #X_1#’s flesh. Although seen by the rest of the play’s characters as an inhuman monster, #X_0# at times diverges from stereotype and reveals himself to be quite human. These contradictions, and his eloquent expressions of hatred, have earned #X_0# a place as one of #X_2#’s most memorable characters.

-- #X_0# --
A wealthy heiress from #Y_0#. #X_0#’s beauty is matched only by her intelligence. Bound by a clause in her father’s will that forces her to marry whichever suitor chooses correctly among three caskets, #X_0# is nonetheless able to marry her true love, #X_2#. Far and away the most clever of the play’s characters, it is #X_0#, in the disguise of a young law clerk, who saves #X_1# from #X_3#’s knife.

-- #X_0# --
The merchant whose love for his friend #X_1# prompts him to sign #X_2#’s contract and almost lose his life. #X_0# is something of a mercurial figure, often inexplicably melancholy and, as #X_2# points out, possessed of an incorrigible dislike of Jews. Nonetheless, #X_0# is beloved of his friends and proves merciful to #X_2#, albeit with conditions.

-- #X_0# --
Although she is #X_2#’s daughter, #X_0# hates life in her father’s house, and elopes with the young Christian gentleman, #X_1#. The fate of her soul is often in doubt: the play’s characters wonder if her marriage can overcome the fact that she was born a Jew, and we wonder if her sale of a ring given to her father by her mother is excessively callous.

-- #X_0# --
A gentleman of #Y_1#, and a kinsman and dear friend to #X_2#. #X_0#’s love for the wealthy #X_3# leads him to borrow money from #Y_0# with #X_2# as his guarantor. An ineffectual businessman, #X_0# proves himself a worthy suitor, correctly identifying the casket that contains #X_3#’s portrait.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_1#’s who accompanies him to #Y_0#. A coarse and garrulous young man, #X_0# is #Y_1#’s most vocal and insulting critic during the trial. While #X_1# courts #X_3#, #X_0# falls in love with and eventually weds #X_3#’s lady-in-waiting, #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_2# and #X_1#, #X_0# is in love with #X_4#’s daughter, #X_3#. He schemes to help #X_3# escape from her father’s house, and he eventually elopes with her to #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s lady-in-waiting and confidante. She marries #X_2# and escorts #X_3# on #X_3#’s trip to #Y_0# by disguising herself as her law clerk.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s servant. A comical, clownish figure who is especially adept at making puns, #X_0# leaves #Y_1#’s service in order to work for #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A Moorish #X_0# who seeks #X_2#’s hand in marriage. #X_0# asks #X_2# to ignore his dark countenance and seeks to win her by picking one of the three caskets. Certain that the caskets reflect #X_2#’s beauty and stature, the #X_0# of #X_0# picks the gold chest, which proves to be incorrect.

-- #X_0# --
An arrogant Spanish nobleman who also attempts to win #X_1#’s hand by picking a casket. Like the #X_0# of #Y_0#, however, the #X_0# of #X_0# chooses unwisely. He picks the silver casket, which gives him a message calling him an idiot instead of #X_1#’s hand.

-- #X_0# --
A Venetian gentleman, and friend to #X_2#, #X_3#, and #X_6#. #X_0# escorts the newlyweds #X_5# and #X_6# to #Y_0#, and returns with #X_3# and #X_4# for #X_2#’s trial. He is often almost indistinguishable from his companion #X_7#.

-- #X_0# --
A Venetian gentleman, and frequent counterpart to #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# ruler of #X_0#, who presides over #X_1#’s trial. Although a powerful man, the #X_0#’s state is built on respect for the law, and he is unable to help #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father, also a servant in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A Jew in #Y_0#, and one of Shylock’s friends.

-- #X_0# --
A wealthy Paduan lawyer and #X_1#’s cousin. #X_0# never appears in the play, but he gives #X_1#’s servant the letters of introduction needed for her to make her appearance in court.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s servant, whom she dispatches to get the appropriate materials from Doctor #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A young civil rights worker and the protagonist of the novel. Thin and slight, with deep brown skin, #X_0# is a deeply sad and serious presence. Bold, defiant, and courageous, #X_0# seems older than she is. Cynical and often pessimistic, she does not fill her life and perceptions with hope. Rather, a stubborn ambivalence often prevails. Later, a serene, detached calm settles on her life. Almost repulsed by sex and the physical aggressions of men, she ultimately prefers her own company. As her illness progresses and her hair falls out, she takes to wearing a knitted cap at all times.

-- #X_0# --
#Y_0#’s former lover and an active participant in the civil rights movement. #X_0# is a handsome man whose intelligence borders on arrogance. His air of pretension and his desire to impress set him apart. He often lapses into French when he knows that the person he is addressing has little or no grasp of the language. Passionate and emotionally volatile, he is unable to resist the powerful pull of the women in his life. At the same time, he can be aloof and distant, an emotional coward who would rather run away from a problem than confront it directly.

-- #X_0# --
A white Jew from the North, and #X_1#’s eventual wife. #X_0# is an argumentative, slightly aggressive woman who is seduced by ideology and her own heightened sense of self-importance, but she is also a selfless and dedicated worker in the movement. Her involvement is rooted partially in guilt and an exaggerated sense of her own complicity in racial injustice and the racism meted out by legions of American whites. Later, her idealism turns to regret, defeat, and a steely resignation as she is plagued with jealousy—of #Y_0#, in particular—and dissatisfaction of the course her life has taken.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s friend at #Y_0# and a radical member of the civil rights movement. #X_0# is judgmental, opinionated, and easily angered, and she has a strong desire to succeed. She is also radical and rebellious, and she brings an intensity to her contributions to the civil rights movement. She cuts off her hair and openly disavows any belief in the Christian faith. At her worst, she is self-centered and incapable of true friendship or emotional vulnerability in any form.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother. A former teacher, #X_0# is deeply religious and has a rigid and unyielding sense of morality and propriety. Despite her deep reserves of faith, she is a fragile spirit who is not up to the tasks and demands of being a wife and mother. At times bitter and spiteful, she feels trapped and short-changed by how her life has turned out and is resigned to self-sacrifice. There is a sense of martyrdom in her acceptance of her status as a second-class citizen. Her stalwart sense of self-denial and her single-minded pursuit of virtue and rightness intimidate #X_1# and those around her, making them feel insufficient and weak.

-- #X_0# --
A former history teacher and farmer. Dreamy, quiet, and unambitious, #X_0# father prefers mostly his own company. He has an abiding interest in historical studies, and he feels a profound connection to the Native Americans who lived on and worked the land before him. Although he is a practicing Baptist, he acknowledges the credence and viability of Native American spirituality as an alternative to the deep Christian faith his wife subscribes to.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_2#’s who works on voter-registration drives in #Y_0#. #X_0# is dedicated and charismatic, and he is successful at getting more southern blacks to register and vote. Later, his less appealing qualities emerge, as his anger and resentment over losing part of his arm boil over into rape and other violence. His desire for revenge and his wish to blame #X_1# for his troubles blind him to reason and mute his otherwise kind and generous nature.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s husband and the father of her son. #X_0# is #X_2#’s high school boyfriend, a stereotypical high school sports hero who never outgrows the popularity and glory he achieved via his athletic prowess and charm. #X_0# is smart and hardworking but lacks the ambition and the ability to pull himself and his family out of their current station. His immaturity is evident through his infidelity and lack of serious commitment to his new family.

-- #X_0# --
A pregnant orphan who lives in the slums surrounding #Y_1#. Believed to be about thirteen, the #X_0# #X_0# is a tough survivor who lives in an abandoned building and survives through scavenging. Uncouth and untouched by any civilizing influences, she has smoked and cursed since an early age. She is also elusive and wary of other people until #Y_0# seizes her.

-- #X_0# --
journalist at the Missoulian newspaper. #X_0#’s many articles about rapes at #Y_1# help attract national media scrutiny and the attention of federal investigators to #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
Also known as #X_2#, #X_0# is Oberon’s jester, a mischievous fairy who delights in playing pranks on mortals. Though A Midsummer Night’s Dream divides its action between several groups of characters, #X_0# is the closest thing the play has to a protagonist. His enchanting, mischievous spirit pervades the atmosphere, and his antics are responsible for many of the complications that propel the other main plots: he mistakes the young Athenians, applying the love potion to Lysander instead of Demetrius, thereby causing chaos within the group of young lovers; he also transforms #X_1#’s head into that of an ass.

-- #X_0# --
The king of the fairies, #X_0# is initially at odds with his wife, #X_2#, because she refuses to relinquish control of a young Indian prince whom he wants for a knight. #X_0#’s desire for revenge on #X_2# leads him to send #X_1# to obtain the love-potion flower that creates so much of the play’s confusion and farce.

-- #X_0# --
The beautiful queen of the fairies, #X_0# resists the attempts of her husband, #X_2#, to make a knight of the young Indian prince that she has been given. #X_0#’s brief, potion-induced love for #X_1#, whose head #X_3# has transformed into that of an ass, yields the play’s foremost example of the contrast motif.

-- #X_0# --
A young man of Athens, in love with Hermia. #X_0#’s relationship with Hermia invokes the theme of love’s difficulty: he cannot marry her openly because Egeus, her father, wishes her to wed Demetrius; when #X_0# and Hermia run away into the forest, #X_0# becomes the victim of misapplied magic and wakes up in love with Helena.

-- #X_0# --
A young man of Athens, initially in love with Hermia and ultimately in love with Helena. #X_0#’s obstinate pursuit of Hermia throws love out of balance among the quartet of Athenian youths and precludes a symmetrical two-couple arrangement.

-- #X_0# --
Egeus’s daughter, a young woman of Athens. #X_0# is in love with Lysander and is a childhood friend of #X_1#. As a result of the fairies’ mischief with Oberon’s love potion, both Lysander and Demetrius suddenly fall in love with #X_1#. Self-conscious about her short stature, #X_0# suspects that #X_1# has wooed the men with her height. By morning, however, Puck has sorted matters out with the love potion, and Lysander’s love for #X_0# is restored.

-- #X_0# --
A young woman of Athens, in love with Demetrius. Demetrius and #X_0# were once betrothed, but when Demetrius met #X_0#’s friend Hermia, he fell in love with her and abandoned #X_0#. Lacking confidence in her looks, #X_0# thinks that Demetrius and Lysander are mocking her when the fairies’ mischief causes them to fall in love with her.

-- #X_0# --
Hermia’s father, who brings a complaint against his daughter to Theseus: #X_0# has given Demetrius permission to marry Hermia, but Hermia, in love with Lysander, refuses to marry Demetrius. #X_0#’s severe insistence that Hermia either respect his wishes or be held accountable to Athenian law places him squarely outside the whimsical dream realm of the forest.

-- #X_0# --
The heroic duke of Athens, engaged to Hippolyta. #X_0# represents power and order throughout the play. He appears only at the beginning and end of the story, removed from the dreamlike events of the forest.

-- #X_0# --
The legendary queen of the Amazons, engaged to Theseus. Like Theseus, she symbolizes order.

-- #X_0# --
The overconfident weaver chosen to play Pyramus in the craftsmen’s play for Theseus’s marriage celebration. #X_0# is full of advice and self-confidence but frequently makes silly mistakes and misuses language. His simultaneous nonchalance about the beautiful #X_2#’s sudden love for him and unawareness of the fact that #X_1# has transformed his head into that of an ass mark the pinnacle of his foolish arrogance.

-- #X_0# --
A carpenter and the nominal leader of the craftsmen’s attempt to put on a play for #X_2#’s marriage celebration. #X_0# is often shoved aside by the abundantly confident #X_1#. During the craftsmen’s play, #X_0# plays the Prologue.

-- #X_0# --
The bellows-mender chosen to play #X_1# in the craftsmen’s play for Theseus’s marriage celebration. Forced to play a young girl in love, the bearded craftsman determines to speak his lines in a high, squeaky voice.

-- #X_0# --
The tailor chosen to play #X_2#’s mother in the craftsmen’s play for Theseus’s marriage celebration. He ends up playing the part of #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The tinker chosen to play Pyramus’s father in the craftsmen’s play for Theseus’s marriage celebration. He ends up playing the part of #X_1#, dividing the two lovers.

-- #X_0# --
The joiner chosen to play the lion in the craftsmen’s play for Theseus’s marriage celebration. #X_0# worries that his roaring will frighten the ladies in the audience.

-- #X_0# --
The fairies ordered by #X_1# to attend to Bottom after she falls in love with him.

-- #X_0# --
A #X_2# midwife and the protagonist of A Midwife’s Tale. A reserved woman, #X_0# deeply values her own autonomy and avoids passing judgment on others. However, she is very firm in her own opinions and finds ways of making her displeasure known when she or someone she likes is slighted. Though #X_0# rarely says so explicity, her actions show that she loves her family and has a comfortable, mutually helpful marriage with #X_1#. #X_0# takes her duties as a nurse and midwife very seriously, giving help to anyone who needs it, no matter what their position in society or her own life situation. Deeply religious, #X_0# is aware of God’s power and influence in her life even when she doesn’t attend meetings. Like all women, #X_0# occasionally feels very tired and sorry for herself, and during these times, the diary serves as an outlet for the feelings she can’t share with her family.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s husband. A surveyor for most of his life, #X_0# is a well-respected man who holds several positions of authority and trust within the community. #X_0# is calm and independent and generally lets #X_1# have full authority over her duties and whereabouts. He angers #X_1# only when he feels she is complaining too much about the help. Finally sick of being attacked, #X_0# quits his surveying job and becomes a tax collector. Though the job leads him to being jailed for debt, #X_0# seems to see his confinement almost as a period of relaxation. When he is home, however, #X_0# is a great help around the house and generally a good friend to #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s oldest son. Quiet and unmarried, #X_0# follows miller jobs wherever they become available and moves in and out of his parents’ house until he is in his early forties. Having developed powerful shoulders through his years of re-chiseling mill stones, #X_0# is a great help to #X_1# whenever he is in town. Though no mention of it is made in the diary, #X_2# theorizes that #X_0# had great difficulty achieving independence due to some sort of mental impairment.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s middle son. #X_0# is brash and drinks too much, and his fits of temper are a source of contention between him and #X_2# for much of her life. On more than one occasion, #X_2# records fights that #X_0# has instigated with neighbors, and though the rest of the family learns to accept these brawls, #X_2#’s descriptions indicate that she remains opposed to his behavior. Despite his temper, #X_0# is very aware of his responsibilities. He marries #X_3# when she gives birth to his child, and he makes sure his mother is taken care of even if it isn’t in the way she might have wanted. #X_1#’s declared heir, #X_0# has occasional problems with debt but works hard to raise the fortunes of himself and his children.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#’s daughters. A quiet, dutiful girl who masters all of the domestic skills necessary to set up a good household of her own, #X_0# is the only daughter living at home during the course of the diary who isn’t mentioned in conjunction with directly helping with her mother’s nursing duties. After her marriage to Moses #X_0#, #X_0#’s focus seems to be on her own large family. Still, #X_0#’s birth so close to the death of her sisters may have led to a special relationship between her and #X_1#, as she is the only child listed at #X_1#’s bedside in the diary’s final entry.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s youngest daughter. The only daughter to develop a specific career of her own, #X_0# trains and begins working as a dressmaker for a period of time before her marriage to Barnabas #X_0#. #X_0# is a hard, uncomplaining worker, and she assists her mother during her midwiving and nursing duties, though she is not always sympathetic enough to #X_2#’s needs. #X_0# is left in charge of #X_2#’s papers after she dies, and she passes the diary on to her daughters.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_2#’s nieces. Sent by her mother, Dorothy #X_0#, to live with #X_2# as a teenager, #X_0# likes the arrangement so well that she stays with #X_2# until she marries Shubael #X_0# and sets up a household of her own. A patient, uncomplaining worker, #X_0# assists #X_2# both through housework and by watching patients when #X_2# can’t do so herself. Baptized during her final illness, #X_2# commends the niece she thinks of as a daughter on her patience and Christian meekness. #X_0# dies at a young age.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s wife and #X_3#’s daughter-in-law. A strong woman who knows what she wants, #X_0# has no trouble claiming #X_2# as the father of her daughter and pressuring him until he agrees to marry her. This strength of will gives both her and #X_3# considerable difficulty when they live under the same roof, each fighting to be mistress of the same space. Though she often complains of #X_3#’s inflexibility, the entries suggest that she behaves similarly when living as a widow under her own son’s roof. #X_0# cares very much for her sister #X_1# and occasionally fulfills nursing needs in the neighborhood.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s neighbor, who murders his family before committing suicide. Sober, industrious, taciturn #X_0# is a respected member of the local militia, and, before the murders, #X_2# bakes for #X_0# and often trades goods with the rest of the family. Early historians have theorized that #X_0# diverts from his original plan to only commit suicide because he needs to control his family’s future. A Universalist, he believes that everyone will be saved regardless of their actions.

-- #X_0# --
A local preacher who #X_2# likes. Somewhat more radical in his religious beliefs than many town leaders, #X_0# is given to suing his enemies and is eventually dismissed from his position. Looking for work out of town at the time, #X_0# seems able to do little to defend his wife’s safety or reputation from the abuse of town leaders. Eventually, he and his family are forced to flee #Y_0# in disgrace and debt. The same traits that brought him and #X_3# such trouble in #Y_0# also get them chased out of several other towns. Eventually, they find a town that accepts their eccentricities.

-- #X_0# --
Another #X_2# diarist often quoted by #X_4#. #X_3#’s neighbor and occasional employer, #X_0# is very conservative in his religious beliefs and is a major force behind driving the #X_1# out of town. #X_0# is highly patriotic and attuned to ceremony, and he disapproves of any activity that even hints of scandal. In his diary, he offers a very male perspective of the time—that is, he seems completely oblivious to the daily rhythms of life going on around him. Even the birth of one of his children is recorded only in #X_3#’s diary, not in his.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s neighbor who is accused of rape. A well-respected member of the community, #X_0# seems to feel sympathy for the woman he is accused of attacking. He is acquitted of #X_3# rape charges and seems to suffer no lasting effects on his career. #X_2# and her family, however, never forgive him, and her daughters go out of their way to have someone else officiate at their weddings.

-- #X_0# --
A #Y_0# physician who sometimes works with #X_2#. #X_0# is intent on developing an obstetrics practice rather than arriving during emergencies like most physicians, and #X_2# thinks him bumbling enough to record more than one of his mistakes for posterity. His skill improves with experience, however, and during the years when #X_2# delivers fewer babies, he is one of the main people whom the expectant mothers request.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s great-great-granddaughter, who inherited the diary. A practicing physician in the late 1800s, #X_0# is one of the first women allowed into the once exclusively male #Y_0#. #X_0# cherishes #X_1#’s diary, admiring her great-grandmother’s skill and professionalism and feeling a deep kinship with her. She donates the diary to #Y_1# to keep it safe and give others greater accessibility to it. Though highly disappointed by the deletions in the incomplete transcript they give her in return, #X_0# is gracious enough to thank the library for their efforts.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist and narrator. #X_0# is a 23-year-old man with a serious drug and alcohol problem. When the book opens, #X_0# is a physical and mental wreck, forced to enter the world’s most successful drug and alcohol clinic. During his stay, he battles his personal demons, makes an unusual group of friends, and falls in love with a drug-addicted former prostitute named #X_1#. He adopts a philosophy of self-reliance and rejects the traditional forms of treatment (as exemplified in the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous). Unlike many of the people he meets in the clinic, #X_0# emerges sober and takes control of his life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s best friend in rehab, rumored to be a mobster. #X_0# is a larger-than-life figure who wears loud clothing and throws dinners for the men in the unit. It is #X_0# who persuades #X_1# to stay at the clinic. At the end of the book, he “adopts” #X_1# as his son.

-- #X_0# --
A fellow patient and eventually #X_1#’s girlfriend. #X_0# was forced into prostitution at a young age to support her mother’s heroin habit. In time, she became a drug addict herself. She was sent to the clinic by her grandmother, a good woman who saved up her money for three years to pay for #X_0#’s treatment. #X_0# is the person most capable of calming #X_1# down during his rages.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#’s roommates. #X_0# is a judge from #Y_0# and a clarinet player. He’s a family man and truly desirous of a recovery. While sharing a room with #X_0#, #X_1# experiences some peace, especially when he falls asleep to #X_0# playing the clarinet. As he does with #X_2#, #X_1# suspects #X_0# of working to get #X_1#’s prison sentence reduced.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s psychologist at the clinic. Like all staff members at the facility, she is a recovering addict. #X_0#is the first to recognize that the best way to deal with #X_2# is to let him make his own decisions.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s unit counselor. #X_0# is a stickler for the rules and doesn’t quite know what to make of #X_1#. He sees #X_1# frequently and genuinely tries to help, but his unwavering belief in the #Y_0# program prevents him and #X_1# from making a true connection.

-- #X_0# --
Unit supervisor at the clinic. #X_0# is the resident tough guy, the person who is called in when the patients get physically out of control. Although gruff, #X_0# can also be a kind person. He constantly butts heads with #X_1# but is made to see #X_1#’s reasoning each time they encounter each other. Near the end of the story, #X_0# and #X_1# set aside their differences and reach a level of mutual respect.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_2#’s first roommates at the clinic. #X_0# is an upper-class type who wears nice, starched shirts. He’s an alcoholic and a gentle man who quickly befriends #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#’s first roommates at the clinic. #X_0# is an ex-con who was molested by his father as a child. He is also a trust-fund baby, something that #X_1# can relate to. #X_0# is one of the strangest patients #X_1# encounters: when he meets people, he gives them a business card advertising himself as a “Sexual Ninja” and explains that he is addicted to anal sex.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_2#’s first roommates at the clinic. He leaves soon after #X_2# arrives without completing the program.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of The Mill on the Floss. The novel tracks #X_0# as she grows from an impetuous, clever child into a striking, unconventional young woman. #X_0#'s closest tie is to her brother #X_2#, and she seeks—and constantly feels denied—his approval and acceptance. #X_0# is clever and enjoys books, the richness of intelligent conversation, and music, but her family's downfall lends her a quieter, troubled side that tends toward self- abnegation. With her dark skin, dark hair, and dark eyes, #X_0# is often associated with the #X_0# side of the family, and, specifically her father's sister, Mrs. #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0#s' older son. #X_0# has his own clear sense of duty, justice, and fairness, and these standards affect his action more so than emotion. #X_0# has affection for #X_3#, but he dislikes her impetuous way of doing what she wants, assuming that she knows better than #X_0#. When Mr. #X_0# goes bankrupt, #X_0# must go to work at a young age and with little experience other than the Latin and Euclid he has learned in school. #X_0# brings the family out of debt and becomes a promising young worker at his uncle #X_1#'s company, #Y_0# #X_0# may be in love with Lucy #X_1#, but he focuses only on his work.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# #X_0#'s mother. Mrs. #X_0# is a dull-witted, stout, blond woman. Formerly a Miss #X_1#, Mrs. #X_0# still maintains that the respectable ways of the #X_1# family are better than the ways of Mr. #X_0#. Mrs. #X_0#'s mind works in small circles—she focuses mainly on tactile objects like the linens and the china. Her husband's bankruptcy makes her confused and listless, and all she can do is wonder what she has done to receive such bad luck. Mrs. #X_0# likes #X_4# more than #X_2# as children, but she grows prouder of #X_2# as #X_2# grows tall, striking, and more demure.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# #X_0#'s father. Mr. #X_0# works the mill on the Floss river, which is on land his family has held for generations. Mr. #X_0# is fond of #X_1#, especially her cleverness, and he often takes her side in family quarrels. Mr. #X_0#'s bankruptcy is, in part, the result of his own single- mindedness and pride. Associated with the older, provincial ways, Mr. #X_0# senses enough of the changing economic world around him to be puzzled by it. #X_0# is an affectionate man, who is soft with his daughter, wife, and sister, yet his bitterness toward Mr. #X_3# consumes and changes him in the end.

-- #X_0# --
The pretty, petite, blond cousin of #X_3# and #X_2#. #X_0# is genuinely good-hearted, thinking often of the happiness of others. She is also enough of a child of society life, though, that she pays heed to social conventions and to her own appearance.

-- #X_0# --
The sensitive and intelligent son of Lawyer #X_0#. #X_0# has had a hunched back since birth. Of small stature and with a pale face, #X_0# is often described as "womanly." #X_0#'s love of art, music, and knowledge go some way toward counteracting the severe sadness he feels about his deformity. #X_0# first meets #X_2# when he is at school with #X_3#. He falls in love with her the year that they meet in secret during #X_2#'s father's bankruptcy.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is a powerful, and increasingly wealthy member of #X_2# society. He remembers his late wife lovingly and is very indulgent but close to his deformed son, #X_1#. #X_0# holds strict ideas about class and money. He is scornful of the vindictive Mr. #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is courting #X_2# #X_1# when we meet him but has not yet proposed marriage. He is the son of the senior partner of #X_0# & Co., where both #X_6# and Mr. #X_1# work. #X_0# is handsome and self-assured. Though he cares for #X_2#, and for the life they would have together, he falls unexpectedly in love with #X_4#, drawn to her strikingly different qualities.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#was a childhood friend of #X_3#'s. Though #X_3# rejected his friendship when they were children over an incident of cheating, #X_0# returns after Mr. #X_4#'s bankruptcy to offer help to #X_2# and #X_3#. #X_0# is a packman—a salesman who buys goods at one place and sells them at another.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0#, formerly Miss Jane #X_1#, acts as the leader of the #X_1# sisters. #X_0# #X_0# is loudly vocal regarding her disapprovals, which usually involve a violation of the #X_1# way of doing something. Yet it is her same strict sense of respectability that allows #X_0# #X_0# to stand by #X_3#, when no one else will at the end of the novel. #X_0#are miserly, though #X_0# #X_0# is more good-natured about thrift. #X_0# #X_0# tries to mediate his wife's ill temper and will stand up to her as well.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0#, formerly Miss Susan #X_1#, is a pale, quieter, #X_1# sister. #X_0# #X_0# does not say much, and she rehearses what she says beforehand. She dies before the end of the novel. #X_0# #X_0# is a swiftly rising junior partner at #Y_0# He focuses on business and profit-making more than family claims. Their daughter is #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0#, formerly Miss Sophie #X_2#, is the closest #X_2# sister to #X_0# #X_4#. They share a love of fine household goods. #X_0# #X_0# is a gentleman farmer, and the couple were originally the most wealthy of the #X_2# family, until #X_0# #X_1# began rising in the business world. #X_0# #X_0# does not have much to say for himself. He covers for this fact by sucking on peppermints.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#works for Mr. #X_2#. He is the miller at the mill on the #Y_0#. #X_0# is practically a family member, and he sits by Mr. #X_2#'s sickbed.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is the auction manager in #Y_0#. #X_0# #X_1# looks up to him as a high class and full of wisdom and intelligence, but #X_0#is more likely middle class and not entirely full of wisdom. #X_0#has died by the middle of the novel.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is the clergyman tutor of #X_2# Tulliver and, later, #X_1#. #X_0# wants to rise in the world and lives somewhat beyond his current means. He teaches exactly as he was taught, with Latin and Euclid. He doesn't have the imagination or the open-mindedness to help #X_2# learn in other ways.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the stern, but charitable, minister of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# #X_0#, #X_0# #X_5#'s sister—and "Aunt Gritty" to #X_4# and #X_1#—is a patient, loving woman. She is especially fond of #X_1#. She has eight children, and the family is very poor. #X_0# #X_5# did not want #X_2# to marry #X_0# #X_0#, and #X_5# is still cross about this. #X_0# #X_0# does not have much character, mainly because he must work too much.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0#, who lives down the Floss, begins a dispute with #X_0# #X_1# over the river water.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the #X_1#' servant.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_0# #X_1#'s lawyer.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is brought in by #X_0# #X_1# to give #X_2# exercise. #X_0# drinks and talks about the war in which he fought.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# #X_0# (there are two) are #X_1# sisters. They are not very attractive and are snobbish.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist and title character. #X_0# is not a happy man. He is unforgiving, incapable of coming to terms with the flaws of human nature, and quick to point out faults in others. He is not an evil man, however, and we may be sympathetic to him given the even manner in which he dispenses criticism—to everyone, including himself. The highly principled #X_0# is brutally honest, which often offends others. He cannot bear flattery or insincere compliment. #X_1# is #X_0#'s greatest source of agony: #X_0# recognizes that love is his weakness and that he cannot reject #X_1#, even though he abhors her behavior. His love for #X_1# is the only force capable of subverting his firm values. #X_0#'s age—he is probably the oldest of the characters—and disposition set him apart from the rest of the company at #X_1#'s home.

-- #X_0# --
A young woman who is the object of desire of several men in The Misanthrope. #X_0#is the center of attention for much of the play. Her suitors—#X_2#, #X_5#, #X_1#, and #X_3#—all seek her affection, yet she makes no firm commitment to any of them. #X_4# implies that #X_0#might somehow belong to #X_2#, possibly through an arranged marriage, but this does not keep her from flirting. #X_0#is happy and confident, but not without fault; she loves to gossip, and she is critical of nearly everyone she meets. She is careless in her insults, and she ultimately stirs the ire of those who once loved her. #X_0#seems to enjoy life for the most part, but she is unwilling to give herself over to the conventions and decorum of her society.

-- #X_0# --
A polite and tactful man who is well adapted to the society of the play. #X_0#, who avoids the type of offensive straightforwardness that characterizes #X_1#, is almost so well adjusted as to come across as boring. #X_0# lacks the sharp wit and cleverness of many of the other characters, but is appealing in his selflessness. #X_0# bears a genuine concern for #X_1# as he seeks to keep #X_1# from destroying all of his relationships. #X_0# is also admirable for his self-control and patience in dealing with the object of his affection, #X_2#. In many ways, #X_0# is the straight man to the absurd and often comically disgruntled #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The object of #X_3#'s romantic attentions. #X_0#possesses a deep understanding of the French society in which she lives. She also demonstrates a keen insight into the relationship between the sexes and occasionally offers a witty critique of how men in love behave. #X_0#is loving and compassionate, if a bit confused about where her own desires lie. She shifts her affections from #X_1# to #X_3# over the course of the play. #X_0#is not shy, as she expresses her opinions of others when the situation demands it. However, #X_0#never reaches the extremes of her cousin #X_2# in gossiping and making fun of the people of the court. #X_0#has found a point of balance between propriety and conformity.

-- #X_0# --
An outspoken man who seeks to be an integral part of his society. Experimenting with poetry, #X_0# fashions himself a multi-talented man, though the mediocrity of his poem calls this particular talent into question. Though he appears confident, he reveals his insecurities when criticized. He cares very much about what people think of him, and he even challenges #X_1# in court for criticizing his poem. Like most of the others, #X_0# is in love with #X_2#. His love is not, however, stronger than his pride, and he abandons #X_2# after she insults him. #X_0# demands the honesty of those with whom he associates. Whether or not he can handle this honesty depends upon the situation.

-- #X_0# --
A bitter woman who is older, unattractive, unpleasant, and thus unable to attract men. #X_0#masks her frustration with extreme manners and piety. She is openly critical of #X_2# out of jealousy, as she herself seeks the love of #X_1#. #X_0#is also willing to betray the confidence of supposed friends, as we see when she tells #X_1# of #X_2#'s deception. Though #X_0#does participate in the gossip and rumor-mongering about the #Y_0#, it does not make her happy. Perhaps the only thing that could make her happy—#X_1#'s love—is beyond her reach.

-- #X_0# --
A young and egotistical marquis. #X_0# considers himself a prime candidate for the role of #X_2#'s lover. He is unabashed in singing his own praises, which may explain his confusion and frustration over #X_2#'s rejection. #X_0# demonstrates true anguish in speaking of his unrequited love for #X_2#; he desires the love of #X_2# to such an extent that he strikes a deal with #X_1# to bolster his chances of wooing her.

-- #X_0# --
Another marquis chasing #X_1#'s love. #X_0# seems less desperate than the other suitors for her affection. His greatest joy comes from his participation in a gossip session with #X_1#. Ultimately, #X_0# has enough pride and confidence to give up on #X_1# when she insults him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s jittery, bumbling manservant. #X_0#'s comic subservience to #X_2# is a major element of the farcical nature of The Misanthrope. Out of nervousness in trying to tell #X_2# everything, #X_0# actually says virtually nothing. #X_0# is of little help to his master, regardless of his good intentions. His ineptitude attracts the sympathy of his theater audience.

-- #X_0# --
Célimène's manservant. #X_0#, a minor character, is loyal to his mistress, promptly announcing the arrival of her visitors.

-- #X_0# --
A messenger of the Marshals of #Y_0#. The #X_0# requests that #X_1# present himself before the Marshals to justify his insult to #X_2#'s poem.

-- #X_0# --
The play's twenty-five-year-old tragic heroine, she is doomed to a cruel demise. Fresh from a broken engagement—an engagement ruined because of her attempt to master her fiancé—#X_0# has become "wild", making shameless advances to her valet, #X_1#. #X_0#'s behavior is supposed to signal sickness. Raised by a shockingly "feminist" mother, #X_0# is simultaneously disgusted by and drawn to men. #X_0# is sado-masochistic. She wants to enslave men, but she also desires her own fall.

-- #X_0# --
The other major character of the play, #X_0# is the manor's thirty-year old valet, chosen as Miss #X_1#'s lover on Midsummer's Eve. Though initially coarse, he pretends to be gallant when seducing Miss #X_1#. His cruelty reveals itself after he has slept with her. #X_0# suffers from class envy. He simultaneously idealizes and degrades #X_1#. Eventually, he becomes a sadist, reveling in #X_1#'s ruin.

-- #X_0# --
A relatively minor character, #X_0# is the manor's thirty-five year old cook and #X_1#'s fiancé. She gossips with #X_1# about Miss #X_2#, and believes wholeheartedly in the class system.

-- #X_0# --
Miss #X_1#'s dog, she is said to look like her mistress. #X_0# symbolizes #X_1#, for she has sex with a mongrel dog that belongs to the gatekeeper.

-- #X_0# --
Miss #X_2#'s canary, she is beheaded by #X_1#. Her decapitation symbolizes the way #X_1# injures #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The main character of the novel. #X_0#works as an advice columnist to his miserable readership at a #Y_0# newspaper, under the eye of his editor, #X_6#. #X_0#is profoundly depressed by the letters he receives and by the moral climate around him. He believes that #X_4# is the only answer, but he has difficult integrating the concepts of Christian love into his personal life, as in his failed relationship with #X_2# and his affairs with #X_5# and #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
Miss #X_2#'s editor at the newspaper. Cynical, hedonistic, grandiloquent, and a womanizer, #X_0# is the novel's anti-Christ of sorts. He is married to #X_3#, who he claims beats him and refuses to give up her virginity. Still, #X_0# lets #X_3# go out with other men to save money. He mocks Miss #X_2# most when it comes to religion, ridiculing his identification with #X_1# and forcing him to dispense false hopes to his readership.

-- #X_0# --
A woman to whom Miss #X_1# had proposed marriage two months prior to the events of the novel, but whom he now avoids her until desire for sex makes him visit her again. #X_0# is ordered, earnest, and virginal, and attributes Miss #X_1#'s illness to city life—she prizes her aunt's old farm above anything else. #X_0#'s naïveté also disallows her from completely understanding Miss #X_1#'s plight and makes her an easy target for his verbal abuse.

-- #X_0# --
A large, nearly grotesquely voluptuous and brutish woman. A great beauty when she was younger, #X_2# married the disabled Peter #X_0# when she did not have enough money to support her daughter by another man. She is unhappy with her life and especially with #X_0#, whom she verbally and physically abuses. #X_2# takes her frustrations out with aggressive advances on Miss #X_3#, who plays the traditionally feminine role of resister to her pursuit.

-- #X_0# --
A worker for a gas company whose foot has been crippled from birth. #X_0#, who was married by convenience to the much stronger #X_1#, wonders what the point of life is and why he keeps on struggling. He is also angry and threatened that #X_1#'s daughter #X_3# is his biological child. #X_0# plays a submissive role to #X_1# while trying to overlook her sexual advances on other men, notably Miss #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s wife. #X_0#has been having an ongoing affair with Miss #X_1# and other men for some time, but #X_2# allows her this, as it saves him money. Still, #X_0#only goes so far as to kiss the men. She enjoys the dreamy atmospheres of nightclubs and restaurants and clearly wishes to escape from her dreary home life.

-- #X_0# --
An anonymous person who pens the longest letter Miss #X_2# receives during the novel. #X_0# Shoulders," like Miss #X_2#'s other readers, writes poorly, in a wrenching torrent of run-on sentences and misspellings that details her life of suffering. She says that she calls herself #X_0#because that is how she feels about life and herself.

-- #X_0# --
An old man #X_3# and his friend #X_4# find in a toilet in the park one night. His real name #X_2#, the old man is interrogated mercilessly and mockingly by the two men.

-- #X_0# --
An irritable friend of Miss #X_2#'s who takes delight in verbally torturing the old man. #X_0# does, however, try to get Miss #X_2# to lay off the old man after a while.

-- #X_0# --
A young woman with whom #X_2# has a date at the speakeasy. #X_0# is interested in intellectual discussions, and is seduced by #X_2#'s eloquent speeches.

-- #X_0# --
A worker at a gas #X_0# near #X_1#'s farm. The #X_0# openly reveals his anti-Semitic beliefs when #X_2# talks to him while gassing up the car.

-- #X_0# --
A co-worker at the newspaper who fills in for Miss #X_1# the day he is too hung over to go to work.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator, and a junior member of the crew of the Pequod. #X_0# doesn’t play a major role in the events of the novel, but much of the narrative is taken up by his eloquent, verbose, and extravagant discourse on whales and whaling.

-- #X_0# --
The egomaniacal captain of the Pequod. #X_0# lost his leg to #X_2#. He is single-minded in his pursuit of the whale, using a mixture of charisma and terror to persuade his crew to join him. As a captain, he is dictatorial but not unfair. At moments he shows a compassionate side, caring for the insane #X_3# and musing on his wife and child back in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The great white sperm whale. #X_0#, also referred to as the White Whale, is an infamous and dangerous threat to seamen, considered by #X_1# the incarnation of evil and a fated nemesis.

-- #X_0# --
The first mate of the #X_2#. #X_0# questions #X_1#’s judgment, first in private and later in public. He is a Quaker who believes that Christianity offers a way to interpret the world around him, although he is not dogmatic or pushy about his beliefs. #X_0# acts as a conservative force against #X_1#’s mania.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s skilled harpooner and #X_1#’s best friend. #X_0# was once a prince from a South Sea island who stowed away on a whaling ship in search of adventure. He is a composite of elements of African, Polynesian, Islamic, Christian, and Native American cultures. He is brave and generous, and enables #X_1# to see that race has no bearing on a man’s character.

-- #X_0# --
The second mate of the #Y_0#. #X_0#, chiefly characterized by his mischievous good humor, is easygoing and popular. He proves a bit of a nihilist, always trusting in fate and refusing to assign too much significance to anything.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s harpooner, #X_0# is a Gay Head Indian from #Y_0#, one of the last of a tribe about to disappear. #X_0# performs many of the skilled tasks aboard the ship, such as tapping the case of spermaceti in the whale’s head. Like #X_1#, #X_0# embodies certain characteristics of the “noble savage” and is meant to defy racial stereotypes. He is, however, more practical and less intellectual than #X_1#: like many a common sailor, #X_0# craves rum.

-- #X_0# --
A native of #Y_1# on Martha’s Vineyard and the third mate of the #Y_0#. Short and stocky, #X_0# has a confrontational attitude and no reverence for anything. His stature has earned him the nickname “King-Post,” because he resembles a certain type of short, square timber.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s harpooner. #X_0# is a physically enormous, imperious-looking African. Like #X_2#, he stowed away on a whaling ship that stopped near his home. #X_0# is less prominent in the narrative than either #X_2# or #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
A young black boy who fills the role of a cabin boy or jester on the Pequod. #X_0# has a minimal role in the beginning of the narrative but becomes important when he goes insane after being left to drift alone in the sea for some time. Like the fools in #X_1#’s plays, he is half idiot and half prophet, often perceiving things that others don’t.

-- #X_0# --
A strange, “oriental” old #X_2# (Persian fire-worshipper) whom #X_1# has brought on board unbeknownst to most of the crew. #X_0# has a very striking appearance: around his head is a turban made from his own hair, and he wears a black Chinese jacket and pants. He is an almost supernaturally skilled hunter and also serves as a prophet to #X_1#. #X_0# keeps his distance from the rest of the crew, who for their part view him with unease.

-- #X_0# --
A well-to-do retired whaleman of #Y_0# and a Quaker. As one of the principal owners of the #Y_1#, #X_0#, along with Captain #X_1#, takes care of hiring the crew. When the two are negotiating wages for #X_2# and #X_3#, #X_0# plays the generous one, although his salary offer is not terribly impressive.

-- #X_0# --
Another well-to-do Quaker ex-whaleman from #Y_0# who owns a large share of the #Y_1#. #X_0# is (or pretends to be) crustier than #X_1# in negotiations over wages. Both men display a business sense and a bloodthirstiness unusual for Quakers, who are normally pacifists.

-- #X_0# --
A former whaleman and now the preacher in #Y_0#. #X_0# delivers a sermon on #X_1# and the whale in which he uses the Bible to address the whalemen’s lives. Learned but also experienced, he is an example of someone whose trials have led him toward God rather than bitterness or revenge.

-- #X_0# --
The jovial captain of the English whaling ship the Samuel Enderby. #X_0# lost his arm in an accident involving #X_2#. Unlike #X_1#, #X_0# is glad to have escaped with his life, and he sees further pursuit of the whale as madness. He is a foil for #X_1#, as the two men react in different ways to a similar experience.

-- #X_0# --
A sailor aboard the Jeroboam. Part of a Shaker sect, #X_0# has prophesied that #X_1# is the incarnation of the Shaker god and that any attempts to harm him will result in disaster.

-- #X_0# --
A Russian Cossack and expatriate who lives on Ship-Trap Island and enjoys hunting men. #X_0#’s high cheekbones, sharply defined nose, and pointed military mustache accentuate his mysteriousness and savagery.

-- #X_0# --
The first child Mother Courage loses to the army. #X_0# is the warlike son, eager to join the war and carry out its brutal business. Ostensibly, his fatal virtue is his #X_1#-like "bravery," though the accolades he receives are certainly in question. His rise to power—reflected in his costume—involves nothing more than a series of cunning, murderous raids on the local peasantry, raids motivated by the need to keep his men fed.

-- #X_0# --
The first of Mother #X_1#'s children to die. #X_0# suffers from an excessive sense of duty and honesty and ultimately dies because of it—in other words, during the war, his virtues cost him his life. #X_1# instills these qualities in him because he is not particularly bright.

-- #X_0# --
The Chaplain's rival for #X_1#'s affections and bread. The #X_0#is an aging #X_2#, a bachelor long past his prime. Darkly ironic, he is all too aware of the war as a continuation of business as usual, continually unmasking the divinely inspired military campaign as another massive profit scheme. In understanding his social position, he bears no loyalty to the rulers who would exploit him: as he tells the Chaplain, he does not eat the King's bread but bakes it.

-- #X_0# --
One of two characters dependent on Mother #X_2# as their "feedbag." The #X_0# initially appears as a cynical, wooden character. He remains loyal to the Swedish monarchy and the campaign as a war of religion though cannot but notice the horrors around him. The #X_0# also reveals more sympathetic qualities, particularly when he defies #X_2# and attempts to save the local peasants at the Battle of #Y_0#. At #Y_0#, the #X_2# Model Book shows him recalling a sense of his former importance and understanding himself as someone oppressed by the war. Indeed, as he will tell the #X_1#, his life as a tramp makes it impossible to return to the priesthood and all its attendant beliefs.

-- #X_0# --
Initially appearing as a camp prostitute, #X_0# is the only character who will make her fortune through the war, marrying and inheriting the estate of a lecherous old Colonel. A woman ruined by the war, she mourns her lost love yet remains bent on securing her interests. #X_1# underlines the price she pays for her wealth with her "disfigurement," #X_0# returning obese and grotesque after her years of marriage. Notably, #X_0# functions as both a sort of object lesson and object of fascination for #X_2#. She would at once harden #X_2# to love and embody a feminine eroticism that #X_2# playfully imitates.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0#'s daughter. #X_0# is wooden, stiff-shouldered daughter, flat- chested, thin, angular and dressed in simple black. She shares her mother #X_2#'s lustrous copper hair and mask-like face. The severe #X_0# considers herself robbed of love at her mother's hands. Thus she schemes to take #X_2#'s place and become the wife of her father and mother of her brother. She ultimately does so upon her mother's death, reincarnating her in her own flesh.

-- #X_0# --
A striking woman of forty with a fine, voluptuous figure, flowing animal grace, and a mass of beautiful copper hair. She wears green, which symbolizes her envy. Her pale face is also a life-like mask, a mask that represents both her duplicity and her almost super-human efforts at repression. Having long abhorred her husband #X_2#, #X_0# plots his murder with her lover #X_1# upon his return from the Civil War.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# son returned from war. #X_0# bears a striking resemblance to his father and Captain #X_1#, though he appears as a weakened, refined, and oversensitive version of each. He possesses a boyish charm that invites the maternal favors of women. He loves his mother incestuously, flying into a jealous rage upon the discovery of her love affair that leads to #X_2# and #X_1#'s deaths. #X_0# will then force he and his sister to judgment for their crimes in an attempt to rejoin his mother in death.

-- #X_0# --
The great #Y_0# general. #X_0# is a spare, big-boned man of exact and wooden movements. His mannerisms suggest the statue-like poses of military heroes. His brusque and authoritative voice has a hollow and repressed quality. As his near- homophonic name suggests, he is #X_2#'s counterpart, the general returned from war to be murdered by his wife and her lover. He continues to exert his influence in symbolic form. His various images, and his portrait in particular, call his family to judgment from beyond the grave.

-- #X_0# --
A powerful, romantic sea captain. #X_0# has a swarthy complexion, sensual mouth, and long, coal-black hair. He also of course bares a striking resemblance to the other #X_3# men, sharing their same, mask-like faces. The child of the illegitimate #X_3# line, he returns to wreak vengeance on #X_1#'s household. He steals #X_1#'s wife, a woman he imagines in the image of his mother, and seduces #X_2# to conceal their affair.

-- #X_0# --
A longtime friend of the #X_4# children. #X_0# is a pretty, healthy, dark- haired girl of nineteen. #X_5# describes her character as frank, innocent, amiable, and good. She functions as #X_6#'s would-be sweetheart, and both #X_2# and #X_3# attempting to pass #X_6# off onto her so they can flee with their suitors. #X_0# also haplessly attempts to rescue #X_6# from his fate.

-- #X_0# --
An artillery captain for the #Y_0#. #X_0# resembles his sister in character. He is straightforward, guileless, and good-natured, failing to apprehend the machinations afoot in the #X_4# house until the very end of the trilogy. He functions as the suitor #X_3# first rejects and later takes up as a substitute for #X_0# #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_1#' aged gardener. #X_0# is stoop-shoulded and raw-boned but still strong. Like his employers, his gaunt face gives the impression of a life-like mask. In his time with the #X_1#, he has learned most of the family's secrets and colluded in keeping them. A watchman figure of sorts, he is repeatedly seen wandering the grounds and singing the sea chanty "Shenandoah."

-- #X_0# --

The eponymous protagonist. The novel begins with #X_0#’s point of view and follows her perspective more closely than that of any other character. As #X_0# prepares for the party she will give that evening, we are privy to her meandering thoughts. #X_0# is vivacious and cares a great deal about what people think of her, but she is also self-reflective. She often questions life’s true meaning, wondering whether happiness is truly possible. She feels both a great joy and a great dread about her life, both of which manifest in her struggles to strike a balance between her desire for privacy and her need to communicate with others. Throughout the day #X_0# reflects on the crucial summer when she chose to marry her husband, #X_3#, instead of her friend #X_1# Walsh. Though she is happy with #X_3#, she is not entirely certain she made the wrong choice about #X_1#, and she also thinks frequently about her friend #X_4#, whom she also once loved.

A World War I veteran suffering from shell shock, married to an Italian woman named #X_3#. Though he is insane, #X_0# views English society in much the same way as #X_2# does, and he struggles, as she does, to both maintain his privacy and fulfill his need to communicate with others. He shares so many traits with #X_2# that he could be her double. #X_0# is pale, has a hawklike posture, and wears a shabby overcoat. Before the war he was a young, idealistic, aspiring poet. After the war he regards human nature as evil and believes he is guilty of not being able to feel. Rather than succumb to the society he abhors, he commits suicide.

The protagonist and narrator of the book. The book traces #X_0#'s development as a person and an artist. He is immensely gifted as an artist and, when younger, not in control of himself. He often seems detached from the world around him and generally spaced out. As he grows older, #X_0# becomes more in touch with himself and learns to channel his feelings into artwork. He is not a typical rebel in the sense that he does not want to rebel. He is simply drawn very strongly to produce art. As he gets older, he outgrows his teacher and becomes more reflective.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s father. A well respected, highly intelligent man. He is incredibly driven to work hard for the cause in which he believes. He has a strong sense of morality and is deeply committed to his religion. His son's misbehavior deeply disturbs and hurts him. Though he works with high-ranking government officials, he has a hard time relating to those, like #X_1#, whose value systems are different from his own.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s mother. She is kind and supportive. Deeply disturbed by the death of her brother, she worries a lot and is, in some ways, a stereotypical "Jewish mother." She is intelligent, loving, and caring; she cares deeply for the two men in her life—#X_3# and #X_2#—and is troubled by their inability to get along.

-- #X_0# --
An old and famous artist. When younger, he abandoned the religion with which he grew up, in order to pursue his artwork. He is fully and completely an artist. He is temperamental, and he feels no moral attachments to anything but art and sees a great purpose in producing art and artists. He is blunt, though generally for a didactic purpose.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s uncle with whom he lives while his parents are in Europe. A wealthy, kind man, who has no distinct personality. He appreciates his nephew's talent in his manner as a layman.

-- #X_0# --
A Ladover man, whom #X_1# helped bring to #Y_0# from #Y_1#. He seems somewhat withdrawn, affected by years of internment in Siberia. He is patient with #X_2#, encouraging of his talent, and more tolerant than most in the community.

-- #X_0# --
The man at #X_2#'s school who is in charge of the spiritual development of the students. He is kind and committed to his community. He expresses concern for the well-being of his students and is genuinely interested in their personal development.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s uncle, who dies when #X_1# is six years old. His death causes #X_1#'s mother to become ill. He is often referenced by #X_1#'s mother, who seems to carry on a relationship with her memories of him. He often seems to serve as an inspiration for #X_1#'s mother.

-- #X_0# --
The woman who helps out around the #X_2# household when #X_2#'s mother is ill. She is often reprimanding #X_2# for not acting like the #X_1# version of a "good" boy. #X_2# often seems to find his interactions with her annoying and frustrating.

-- #X_0# --
An international socialite and gallery owner. She is interested in art and artists and even more interested in using them to make money.

-- #X_0# --
The youngest #X_0# child and the protagonist of the novel. Described                 by her father as their family’s constant, thirteen-year-old #X_0# is smart, funny,                 and observant. #X_0#’s actions drive the plot, as she struggles to reconcile her                 knowledge that only she can provide #X_1#, whom she loves dearly, with the organs she                 needs to survive and her desire to live without this extraordinary burden. While the                 rest of the family has often been left to sit idly by in #X_1#’s fight against                 cancer, #X_0#, because her genes match #X_1#’s, has been an active participant. #X_0#’s                 role in #X_1#’s survival has been a blessing and a curse for her, as it has made her                 #X_1#’s savior but has also made #X_0# unable to be her own person.

-- #X_0# --
The mother of the #X_0# family. #X_0# is strong, stubborn, and                 intelligent, and her life centers on her efforts to keep #X_1# alive. She has                 extremely strong maternal instincts, but her single-minded focus on saving #X_1#                 sometimes exists at the expense of her marriage and her relationships with her two                 other children. Even so, she has a deep and abiding love for all her family, though                 she does not always know how to show that love.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s lawyer. Initially arrogant and brusque, #X_0# gradually emerges                 as a character with many layers. In many ways, he mirrors #X_1#. Both have found it                 difficult to be who their parents want them to be, and both have secrets they are                 unwilling to share. #X_0# struggles between his urge to erect barriers around                 himself and his genuine desire to reach out to people. He ultimately experiences the                 most personal growth of any of the characters, and by the end of the story he has                 formed strong bonds with the people around him.

-- #X_0# --
The father of the #X_0# children and a career firefighter. #X_0#                 often serves as a foil to #X_1#. In contrast to her, he can view the situation from                 his children’s perspectives, making him both more perceptive and understanding than                 #X_1# at times. Yet #X_0# also escapes into his work to avoid dealing with the                 hardships surrounding his family. He can be kinder than #X_1#, but by the end of the                 story #X_1# proves to be the emotionally stronger of the two.

-- #X_0# --
The oldest of the #X_0# children and the most delinquent. Despite                 his tough exterior, #X_0# is in reality a vulnerable and sensitive character. He                 uses his destructive behavior to mask a fundamental feeling of inadequacy. #X_0#                 cannot save #X_1#, and he has never been able to forgive himself for that. In                 addition, he has often felt ignored by his parents, who focus their attention almost                 exclusively on #X_1#, and he acts out in part to gain their                 attention.

-- #X_0# --
The middle #X_0# child and the focal point of many of the novel’s                 events. #X_0#’s cancer is at the heart of the story, but she only narrates the                 prologue and epilogue. She has struggled with cancer nearly her entire life, and she                 appears to have come to terms with the fact that she might die. The reader sees                 glimpses of the girl #X_0# could have been, but for the most part her battle with                 cancer defines her character.

-- #X_0# --
Guardian ad litem to #X_2# and #X_3#’s high-school girlfriend. #X_0#                 has a genuine desire to discover what is best for #X_2# and is one of the most open                 and caring characters in the story. She possesses an independent personality that                 made her an outsider in high school but now makes her ideally suited for rendering                 an objective opinion on #X_2#’s case.

-- #X_0# --
#X_5#’s older sister. #X_0#, a high-powered career woman without children,                 provides a foil to #X_5#, who could have been a successful attorney but essentially                 gave up her law career to care for her children full-time. #X_0#often gives #X_2#                 and #X_5# comfort and support. For instance, she watches #X_1# and #X_3# when #X_5#                 goes with #X_4# to the hospital and #X_2# has to work. Her relationship with #X_5#                 offers another example of the unique bond that exists between                 sisters.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s oncologist. A warm but serious man, #X_0#represents the                 science and medicine keeping #X_2# alive. He speaks to #X_3# and #X_1# very honestly                 and directly about #X_2#’s condition, yet no matter how bleak #X_2#’s situation gets,                 #X_0#always offers hope that a treatment may work, even when the chances are                 slim.

-- #X_0# --
The judge appointed to #X_1#’s case. Fair and kind, #X_0#                genuinely cares for #X_1#’s well-being. As the father of a child killed by a drunk                 driver, he understands how desperately #X_4# and #X_2# want to keep #X_3#                 alive.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s crush and fellow cancer patient. #X_1# and #X_0#’s short                 relationship emphasizes that, at heart, #X_1# is a normal teenage girl. Yet #X_0#’s                 sudden death underscores the fact that #X_1#’s condition remains extremely fragile                 and that she could die with little warning.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s twin sister and roommate. #X_0#’s dislike of #X_2# reflects how                 much he hurt #X_3#, and her presence in the story serves as another example of the                 extreme closeness that can exist between sisters.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s service dog. #X_1# does not reveal why he needs #X_0# for                 most of the book. Ultimately he reveals that #X_0# is an epilepsy service dog,                 meaning he alerts #X_1# if a seizure is imminent so #X_1# can move to a safe                 environment.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
Roman name: Mars. A vicious god, #X_0# is hated by both his father, Zeus, and mother, #X_1#. The god of War, he is always bloody and ruthless, yet we see in his vain bullying that he is also, paradoxically, a coward.

-- #X_0# --
Roman name: Vulcan or #X_3#. #X_0# is either the son of Zeus and #X_2#, or simply of #X_2# alone, who gives birth to him in retaliation for Zeus’s solo fathering of #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
Roman name: Ceres. Though a sister of Zeus, #X_0# lives on earth. #X_0# is the goddess of corn and harvest.

-- #X_0# --
Three mysterious sisters who affect the paths of all in the universe. #X_2# spins the thread of life, #X_3# assigns each person’s thread, and #X_1# snips the thread of life at its end.

-- #X_0# --
The son of King Aegeus of Athens and a quintessential Athenian hero. #X_0# is the model citizen: a kind leader, good to his friends and countrymen. #X_0# does have his shortcomings, however: he abandons Ariadne, and later doubts his own son, which leads to his tragic demise.

-- #X_0# --
One of the least impressive of the Greek heroes. #X_0#’s most notable feat is his assembly of a cast of heroes to travel on a long fraudulent quest—the recovery of the Golden #X_1#. When #X_0# arrives in #Y_0# to retrieve the #X_1#, the daughter of the king, #X_2#, falls in love with him. #X_0# abandons her and marries a princess later for political gain.

The most famous Greek in the Trojan War, whose strength and bravery are unrivaled. #X_0# is selfless, courageous, and devoted to the gods—he is the finest Greek warrior.

He bears the burden of delaying Ragnarok, the day of doom for both the gods and mortals, as long as possible.

The counterpart of Zeus in Norse mythology. #X_0# is a quiet, brooding figure. He trades one of his eyes and suffers for nine nights to attain the insights of the Well of Wisdom, which he passes on to men along with the mystical powers of the runes and poetry. #X_0# rewards fallen warriors with a place in Valhalla, the Hall of the Slain. He bears the burden of delaying Ragnarok, the day of doom for both the gods and mortals, as long as possible.

-- #X_0# --
A fearful goddess who presides over the realm of the dead, which is called Hel (not synonymous with our word “hell,” however). The fact that a female occupies this position is a significant and striking difference from Greek and Roman myth.

#X_0# “Choosers of the Slain,” these splendid female warriors select and carry dead warriors to Valhalla.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, wronged by her husband, conceives a son with her brother #X_1#. She bides her time until the son is old enough to help #X_1# kill her husband. #X_0# then kills herself by walking into the fire that also consumes her husband and her other children.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s son, a fierce warrior who braves a ring of fire for the love of the beautiful woman-warrior #X_1#. #X_3# is always honest, brave, fierce, and giving, thus embodying the ideal Norse warrior. He is the prototype for #X_2#, popularized in #X_4#’s  Ring Cycle.

-- #X_0# --
A #X_3# who angers #X_2# and is punished with imprisonment in a ring of fire. She is a dazzling character, with strength both of soul and body. She is the prototype for #X_4#'s #X_1#, the most famous #X_3# in opera.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s primary protagonist. #X_0# is an obedient, inquisitive, and sensitive child, close to his parents and sister. The novel tracks #X_0#’s growth from child into young man. This growth includes changing his name, to #X_2#, and the gradual discovery of architecture as a career. #X_0# navigates, over time, his relationship to his parents’ identity, as Bengalis in #Y_0#. He also tries to forge his own identity, as a Bengali-#Y_0#n child born in the #Y_1#. At the close of the novel, #X_0# begins reading Nikolai #X_0#, his namesake, as a way of getting closer to his deceased father, who adored the writer.

-- #X_0# --
Another of the novel’s protagonists. #X_0#, at the beginning of the novel, does not make choices so much as she accepts the choices of others. Her parents arrange her marriage to #X_1#, and out of duty she follows him to cold, desolate-seeming #Y_0#. She grows to love her husband, and, later, her son #X_2# and daughter #X_3#. But for years, #X_0# misses her family in #Y_1# and yearns desperately for her old life there. Only after many years, and following her husband’s death while away in #Y_2#, does #X_0# realize that the #Y_0# area is her home, and that she is surrounded by friends and a surrogate family there.

-- #X_0# --
The third of the novel’s protagonists. #X_0# is a quiet, sensitive man, and although the narrator does not have access to many of his thoughts, he is nevertheless devoted to his wife and children. #X_0# is also deeply affected by the train accident that nearly killed him in his youth. He gives his son the name #X_1# as an acknowledgment of what that writer means to him. Nikolai #X_1# and the other Russian writers are also emblems of “foreignness,” of a life lived in exile. This is the life #X_0# has chosen for himself, as a PhD student and then professor in the #Y_1#, far from his family in #Y_0#. #X_0# chose to set out for himself, in a place of his choosing, after the train accident solidified his resolve to see the world.

-- #X_0# --
The fourth member of the #X_0# family in #Y_0#. Although the reader very rarely has access to #X_0#’s thoughts, she is a constant, calming presence for the family. She goes to school and lives for a time in #Y_1#, but after #X_2#’s death, #X_0# returns to the #Y_0# area, where she practices law and becomes engaged to a man named #X_3#. #X_0# is a steadying presence for #X_1# after #X_2#’s passing.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s wife. #X_0# knew #X_2# when he was a young boy, and the two are set up on a blind date, in #Y_0#, by their parents. #X_0# is a graduate student in French literature and adores #Y_1#. She also adores, in part, the cosmopolitan life she lived there, with a banker named #X_3#, who left her and broke her heart. #X_0# marries #X_2# but, after a time, becomes restless in the marriage, and enjoys more and more the company of her intellectual friends. #X_0# begins an affair with #X_1#, an old acquaintance, and later she and #X_2# divorce. #X_0#’s point of view is included, though not frequently, in the novel. We learn, for example, of the dissolution of #X_0#’s first engagement, to the American banker, via access to her own thoughts, although the narrator retains the third person in these sections.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s second serious girlfriend. #X_0# and #X_3# meet in #Y_0#, at a party. #X_0# represents, for #X_3#, a life very different from his own. She lives with her parents downtown, in a beautiful townhouse, and shares their intellectual, cosmopolitan life. #X_0# does not always understand #X_3#’s family’s traditions, but she tries to, and seems to care genuinely for him. After #X_2#’s death, #X_3# pulls away from #X_0#, leaving her out of the mourning ceremonies. They soon separate.

an aimless academic, and #X_2#’s illicit lover. #X_0# met #X_2# when she was in high school and he was applying to PhD programs. #X_2# finds #X_0#’s information by change, and they begin an affair. #X_2# knows that her tryst with #X_0# is wrong, and that he is something of a slob and a dilettante. But this does not keep her from the affair.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s parents. Wealthy and intellectually inclined, #X_0# and #X_0# open their home to #X_4#, whom they seem to admire. They are comfortable in their world of #Y_0# society, and though they are kind to #X_2#, he never quite feels a part of their circle.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s intellectual friends in #Y_0#. #X_0# are, in #X_2#’s mind, the kind of people who find their own choices to be the only correct ones. Although #X_0# seem open and liberal, they are in fact quite set in their ways. #X_2# is frustrated by what he views as their selfishness.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s ex-fiancé. A banker in #Y_1#, #X_0#, an #Y_0#n, moves back to #Y_0# with #X_1#, and they plan a life together. But #X_1# realizes that #X_0# has reservations about the traditions that come with marrying a Bengali-#Y_0#n, and they break up.

-- #X_0# --

#X_2# and #X_1#’s neighbors in #Y_0#. #X_0# are free-spirits and liberals, and though #X_2# and #X_1# find them nice and compassionate to live near, they are also confused by the informality of #X_0#’s lives, and by the cavalier way in which #X_0# raise and keep track of their children.

-- #X_0# --
The author and narrator of the Narrative. #X_0#, a rhetorically skilled and spirited man, is a powerful orator for the abolitionist movement. One of his reasons for writing the Narrative is to offer proof to critics who felt that such an articulate and intelligent man could not have once been a slave. The Narrative describes #X_0#’s experience under slavery from his early childhood until his escape North at the age of twenty. Within that time, #X_0# progresses from unenlightened victim of the dehumanizing practices of slavery to educated and empowered young man. He gains the resources and convictions to escape to the North and wage a political fight against the institution of slavery.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s first master and probably his father. #X_0# is the clerk for Colonel #X_4#, managing #X_4#’s surrounding plantations and the overseers of those plantations. #X_0# is a cruel man who takes pleasure in whipping his slaves, especially #X_2#’s Aunt #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
Captain #X_2#’s boss and #X_3#’s first owner. #X_0# #X_0# is an extremely rich man who owns all of the slaves and lands where #X_3# grows up. #X_0# insists on extreme subservience from his slaves and often punishes them unjustly.

Lucretia #X_0#’s husband and Hugh #X_0#’s brother. #X_0# #X_0# did not grow up owning slaves, but gained them through his marriage to Lucretia.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4# #X_0#’s brother and #X_1#’s occasional master. #X_0# lives in #Y_0# with his wife, #X_3#. #X_4# and Lucretia #X_0# allow #X_0# to borrow #X_1# as a servant for #X_0#’s son, #X_4#. #X_0# is well aware that whites maintain power over blacks by depriving them of education, and he unwittingly enlightens #X_1# in this matter. #X_0# is not as cruel as his brother #X_4#, but he becomes harsher due to a drinking habit in his later years. #X_0# seems to suffer some consciousness that slavery and the law’s treatment of blacks are inhumane, but he does not allow this consciousness to interfere with his exercising power over #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# #X_0#’s wife. #X_0# was a working woman before marrying #X_1#, and she had never owned slaves. The corruption of owning a slave transforms #X_0# from a sympathetic, kind woman into a vengeful monster.

A notorious slave “breaker” and #X_1#’s keeper for one year. Slave owners send their unruly slaves to #X_0#, who works and punishes them (thus getting free labor to cultivate his rented land) and returns them trained and docile. #X_0#’s tactics as a slaveholder are both cruel and sneaky. He is deliberately deceptive and devious when interacting with his slaves, creating an atmosphere of constant surveillance and fear.

A slave acquaintance of #X_2#. The highly superstitious #X_0# stands in the Narrative as a representative of all uneducated, superstitious slaves. #X_0# is kind to #X_2# when #X_2# runs away from #X_1#’s, but the Narrative also implies that #X_0# may have informed #X_3# about #X_2#’s plans to escape.

The protagonist of Native Son. A poor, uneducated black man, #X_0# comes from the lowest rung on the American social and economic ladder. As his lack of education has left him no option other than menial labor, he has felt trapped his whole life, resenting, hating, and fearing the whites who define the narrow confines of his existence. #X_0# views white people as a collective, overwhelming force that tells him where to live, where to work, and what to do.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of Mr. and Mrs. #X_0#, #X_1#’s wealthy employers. #X_0# identifies herself as a progressive, dates an admitted communist, and interacts with #X_1# with little regard for the strict boundary society imposes between black men and white women. #X_0#’s transgression of this boundary leads to her death and the resulting development of #X_1#’s character.

-- #X_0# --
A white millionaire couple living in #Y_0#. #X_0# #X_0# is blind; #X_0# #X_0# has earned a fortune in real estate.

#X_2#’s younger brother. #X_0#, unlike his brother, does not rebel against his low position on the social ladder. In fact, he envies #X_2#’s job as a chauffeur for a rich white family. As the novel progresses, however, #X_0# begins to take on a more antagonistic attitude toward racial prejudice.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s younger sister. #X_0#, like #X_2#, lives her life in constant fear.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s friends, who often plan and execute robberies together. #X_0# hatch a tentative plan to rob a white shopkeeper, Mr. #X_2#, but they are afraid of the consequences if they should be caught robbing a white man.

In the mythological world of The Natural, #X_0#is #X_1#'s Excalibur. It is also an unquestionable phallic symbol; when #X_1# is in a slump, the bat is said to "sag like a baloney."

The protagonist of the novel, he is also the narrator, writing down his observations in diary format. After traveling around most of Africa and the Far East, he returned to #Y_0# to complete his historical research on #X_1#. Yet, not only has he lost interest in his research, but something about the way he sees both himself and the outside world begins to worry him. Whether it is holding a stone or looking at a glass of beer, he feels confronted by the bare existence of things. The result is what he calls the Nausea. He soon realizes that the Nausea comes from the fact that "existence precedes essence." He thinks the physical characteristics of objects and people are just a comforting facade to mask the "nothingness" of existence. By the end of the novel he has disavowed the past, embraced his existence, and discovered that there is no purpose to existence. Rather than surrender to despair, he decides to assert his freedom and moves to #Y_1# to write a novel.

At first #X_1# thinks he can learn everything about him, but soon realizes that not only is he guessing about who the marquis really was, but he is also using him to justify his existence. #X_1#'s rejection of #X_0# is thus a rejection of living in the past.

She is #X_1#'s old lover and lives in #Y_0#. Even though she begs #X_1# to come see her, she is more interested in the man he used to be.

-- #X_0# --
A lonely man whom #X_1# meets at the Bouville #Y_0#. #X_1# mocks him for thinking he can learn all there is to know by reading everything in the #Y_0# in alphabetical order.

Her one night of radiance cost her and Monsieur #X_0# any chance for future happiness.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_2#'s and a clerk in #Y_0#, #X_0# is an important character because of his actions. He gives #X_2# a place to stay and an ear to listen whenever #X_2# needs one. However, it is #X_0# who tells #Y_1# about #X_1# being an osu. Still, #X_0# may be doing this because he believes it best for #X_2# not to marry #X_1#.

While #X_0# has read many novels (particularly Gothic novels), she is very inexperienced at reading people.

Their story is constantly repeated in The Odyssey to offer an inverted image of the fortunes of Odysseus and Telemachus.

-- #X_0# --
The beautiful daughter of King Alcinous and Queen #X_1# of the Phaeacians. #X_0# discovers Odysseus on the beach at Scheria and, out of budding affection for him, ensures his warm reception at her parents’ palace.

-- #X_0# --
King of the Phaeacians, who offers Odysseus hospitality in his island kingdom of Scheria. #X_0# hears the story of Odysseus’s wanderings and provides him with safe passage back to Ithaca.

-- #X_0# --
Queen of the Phaeacians, wife of Alcinous, and mother of Nausicaa. #X_0# is intelligent and influential. Nausicaa tells Odysseus to make his appeal for assistance to #X_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of #X_0# the King and #X_0# at Colonus. #X_0# becomes king of Thebes before the action of #X_0# the King begins. He is renowned for his intelligence and his ability to solve riddles—he saved the city of Thebes and was made its king by solving the riddle of the Sphinx, the supernatural being that had held the city captive. Yet #X_0# is stubbornly blind to the truth about himself. His name’s literal meaning (“swollen foot”) is the clue to his identity—he was taken from the house of Laius as a baby and left in the mountains with his feet bound together. On his way to Thebes, he killed his biological father, not knowing who he was, and proceeded to marry #X_1#, his biological mother.

-- #X_0# --
Oedipus’s wife and mother, and Creon’s sister. #X_0# appears only in the final scenes of Oedipus the King. In her first words, she attempts to make peace between Oedipus and Creon, pleading with Oedipus not to banish Creon. She is comforting to her husband and calmly tries to urge him to reject Tiresias’s terrifying prophecies as false. #X_0# solves the riddle of Oedipus’s identity before Oedipus does, and she expresses her love for her son and husband in her desire to protect him from this knowledge.

-- #X_0# --
Child of Oedipus and Jocasta, and therefore both Oedipus’s daughter and his sister. #X_0# appears briefly at the end of Oedipus the King, when she says goodbye to her father as Creon prepares to banish Oedipus. She appears at greater length in Oedipus at Colonus, leading and caring for her old, blind father in his exile. But #X_0# comes into her own in #X_0#. As that play’s protagonist, she demonstrates a courage and clarity of sight unparalleled by any other character in the three #X_1# plays. Whereas other characters—Oedipus, Creon, Polynices—are reluctant to acknowledge the consequences of their actions, #X_0# is unabashed in her conviction that she has done right.

-- #X_0# --
Oedipus’s brother-in-law, #X_0# appears more than any other character in the three plays combined. In him more than anyone else we see the gradual rise and fall of one man’s power. Early in Oedipus the King, #X_0# claims to have no desire for kingship. Yet, when he has the opportunity to grasp power at the end of that play, #X_0# seems quite eager. We learn in Oedipus at Colonus that he is willing to fight with his nephews for this power, and in Antigone #X_0# rules Thebes with a stubborn blindness that is similar to Oedipus’s rule. But #X_0# never has our sympathy in the way Oedipus does, because he is bossy and bureaucratic, intent on asserting his own authority.

-- #X_0# --
Son of Oedipus, and thus also his brother. #X_0# appears only very briefly in Oedipus at Colonus. He arrives at Colonus seeking his father’s blessing in his battle with his brother, Eteocles, for power in Thebes. #X_0# tries to point out the similarity between his own situation and that of Oedipus, but his words seem opportunistic rather than filial, a fact that Oedipus points out.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, the blind soothsayer of Thebes, appears in both Oedipus the King and Antigone. In Oedipus the King, #X_0# tells Oedipus that he is the murderer he hunts, and Oedipus does not believe him. In Antigone, #X_0# tells Creon that Creon himself is bringing disaster upon Thebes, and Creon does not believe him. Yet, both Oedipus and Creon claim to trust #X_0# deeply. The literal blindness of the soothsayer points to the metaphorical blindness of those who refuse to believe the truth about themselves when they hear it spoken.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s son, who appears only in #X_1#. #X_0# is engaged to marry #X_1#. Motivated by his love for her, he argues with #X_2# about the latter’s decision to punish her.

-- #X_0# --
Oedipus’s daughter #X_0# appears at the end of Oedipus the King and to a limited extent in Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone. #X_0#’s minor part underscores her sister’s grandeur and courage. #X_0# fears helping Antigone bury Polynices but offers to die beside Antigone when Creon sentences her to die. Antigone, however, refuses to allow her sister to be martyred for something she did not have the courage to stand up for.

-- #X_0# --
The king of Athens in Oedipus at Colonus. A renowned and powerful warrior, #X_0# takes pity on Oedipus and defends him against Creon. #X_0# is the only one who knows the spot at which Oedipus descended to the underworld—a secret he promises Oedipus he will hold forever.

-- #X_0# --
Sometimes comically obtuse or fickle, sometimes perceptive, sometimes melodramatic, the #X_0# reacts to the events onstage. The #X_0#’s reactions can be lessons in how the audience should interpret what it is seeing, or how it should not interpret what it is seeing.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s wife.

-- #X_0# --
A large, lumbering, childlike migrant worker. Due to his intellectual disability, #X_0# completely depends upon #X_1#, his friend and traveling companion, for guidance and protection. The two men share a vision of a farm that they will own together, a vision that #X_0# believes in wholeheartedly. Gentle and kind, #X_0# nevertheless does not understand his own strength. His love of petting soft things, such as small animals, dresses, and people’s hair, leads to disaster.

-- #X_0# --
A small, wiry, quick-witted man who travels with, and cares for, #X_1#. Although he frequently speaks of how much better his life would be without his caretaking responsibilities, #X_0# is obviously devoted to #X_1#. #X_0#’s behavior is motivated by the desire to protect #X_1# and, eventually, deliver them both to the farm of their dreams. Though #X_0# is the source of the often-told story of life on their future farm, it is #X_1#’s childlike faith that enables #X_0# to actually believe his account of their future.

-- #X_0# --
An aging ranch handyman, #X_0# lost his hand in an accident and worries about his future on the ranch. Fearing that his age is making him useless, he seizes on #X_2#’s description of the farm he and #X_3# will have, offering his life’s savings if he can join #X_2# and #X_3# in owning the land. The fate of #X_0#’s ancient dog, which #X_1# shoots in the back of the head in an alleged act of mercy, foreshadows the manner of #X_3#’s death.

-- #X_0# --
The only female character in the story, #X_0# is never given a name and is only mentioned in reference to her husband. The men on the farm refer to her as a “tramp,” a “tart,” and a “looloo.” Dressed in fancy, feathered red shoes, she represents the temptation of female sexuality in a male-dominated world. #X_2# depicts #X_0# not as a villain, but rather as a victim. Like the ranch-hands, she is desperately lonely and has broken dreams of a better life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, the black stable-hand, gets his name from his crooked back. Proud, bitter, and caustically funny, he is isolated from the other men because of the color of his skin. Despite himself, #X_0# becomes fond of #X_1#, and though he derisively claims to have seen countless men following empty dreams of buying their own land, he asks #X_1# if he can go with them and hoe in the garden.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, the boss's son, wears high-heeled boots to distinguish himself from the field hands. Rumored to be a champion prizefighter, he is a confrontational, mean-spirited, and aggressive young man who seeks to compensate for his small stature by picking fights with larger men. Recently married, #X_0# is plagued with jealous suspicions and is extremely possessive of his flirtatious young wife.

-- #X_0# --
A highly skilled mule driver and the acknowledged “prince” of the ranch, #X_0# is the only character who seems to be at peace with himself. The other characters often look to #X_0# for advice. For instance, only after #X_0# agrees that #X_1# should put his decrepit dog out of its misery does the old man agree to let #X_2# shoot it. A quiet, insightful man, #X_0# alone understands the nature of the bond between #X_3# and #X_4#, and comforts #X_3# at the book’s tragic ending.

-- #X_0# --
A ranch-hand, #X_0# complains bitterly about #X_1#’s old, smelly dog. He convinces #X_1# to put the dog out of its misery. When #X_1# finally agrees, #X_0# promises to execute the task without causing the animal any suffering. Later, #X_2# uses #X_0#’s gun to shoot #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# stocky, well-dressed man in charge of the ranch, and #X_2#’s father. He is never named and appears only once, but seems to be a fair-minded man. #X_1# happily reports that the boss once delivered a gallon of whiskey to the ranch-hands on Christmas Day.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s aunt, who cared for him until her death, does not actually appear in the work except at the end, as a vision chastising #X_3# for causing trouble for #X_2#. By all accounts, she was a kind, patient woman who took good care of #X_3# and gave him plenty of mice to pet.

-- #X_0# --
A ranch-hand.

-- #X_0# --
The old man of the novella’s title, #X_0# is a Cuban fisherman who has had an extended run of bad luck. Despite his expertise, he has been unable to catch a fish for eighty-four days. He is humble, yet exhibits a justified pride in his abilities. His knowledge of the sea and its creatures, and of his craft, is unparalleled and helps him preserve a sense of hope regardless of circumstance. Throughout his life, #X_0# has been presented with contests to test his strength and endurance. The marlin with which he struggles for three days represents his greatest challenge. Paradoxically, although #X_0# ultimately loses the fish, the marlin is also his greatest victory.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# hooks the #X_0#, which we learn at the end of the novella measures eighteen feet, on the first afternoon of his fishing expedition. Because of the #X_0#’s great size, #X_2# is unable to pull the fish in, and the two become engaged in a kind of tug-of-war that often seems more like an alliance than a struggle. #X_0# fishing line serves as a symbol of the fraternal connection #X_2# feels with the fish. When the captured #X_0# is later destroyed by sharks, #X_2# feels destroyed as well. Like #X_2#, the #X_0# is implicitly compared to #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A boy presumably in his adolescence, #X_0# is #X_1#’s apprentice and devoted attendant. The old man first took him out on a boat when he was merely five years old. Due to #X_1#’s recent bad luck, #X_0#’s parents have forced the boy to go out on a different fishing boat. #X_0#, however, still cares deeply for the old man, to whom he continues to look as a mentor. His love for #X_1# is unmistakable as the two discuss baseball and as the young boy recruits help from villagers to improve the old man’s impoverished conditions.

-- #X_0# --
Although #X_0# never appears in the novel, he plays a significant role nonetheless. #X_1# worships him as a model of strength and commitment, and his thoughts turn toward #X_0# whenever he needs to reassure himself of his own strength. Despite a painful bone spur that might have crippled another player, #X_0# went on to secure a triumphant career. He was a center fielder for #Y_0# from 1936 to 1951, and is often considered the best all-around player ever at that position.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, the reader assumes, owns the bodega in #X_1#’s village. He never appears in the novel, but he serves an important role in the fisherman’s life by providing him with newspapers that report the baseball scores. This act establishes him as a kind man who helps the aging #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
Like #X_2#, #X_0#, a café owner in #X_3#’s village, does not appear in the story. The reader learns of him through #X_1#, who often goes to #X_0# for #X_3#’s supper. As the old man says, #X_0# is a man of frequent kindness who deserves to be repaid.

-- #X_0# --
The creator of the world and an all-powerful being. #X_0# calls himself the only true deity worthy of human worship. As the figurehead of #Y_0# and the force behind every event, #X_0# acts as the unseen hero of the Old Testament. #X_0# reveals his intentions by speaking to people. Physical manifestations of #X_0# are always indirect or symbolic. #X_0# appears in many different forms, including an angel, a wrestler, a burst of fire, and a quiet whisper.

-- #X_0# --
The patriarch of the Hebrew people. #X_0# is traditionally called “Father #X_0#” because the Israelite people and their religion descend from him. God establishes his covenant, or promise, with #X_0#, and God develops an ongoing relationship with the Israelites through #X_0#’s descendants. #X_0# practices the monotheistic worship of God, and his resilient faith in God, despite many challenges, sets the pattern for the Israelite religion’s view  of righteousness.

-- #X_0# --
The reluctant savior of #Y_0# in its exodus from Egyptian bondage to the promised land. #X_0# mediates between #X_1# and the people, transforming the #Y_0#ites from an oppressed ethnic group into a nation founded on religious laws. #X_0#’s legendary miracles before #X_2#, along with his doubts and insecurities, make him the great mortal hero of the Old Testament. He is the only man ever to know #X_1# “face to face.” Four out of the five books of the Pentateuch are devoted to #X_0# and #Y_0#’s activities under  his leadership.

-- #X_0# --
The king of #Y_0# and the founder of Jerusalem, or “Zion.” #X_0#’s reign marks the high point of #Y_0# in the biblical narrative. Although #X_0#’s claim to the throne is threatened by Saul and by #X_0#’s own son, Absalom, #X_0# maintains his power by blending shrewd political maneuvering with a magnanimous and forgiving treatment of his enemies. #X_0#’s decision to bring the Ark of the Covenant—#Y_0#’s symbol of God—to the capital of Jerusalem signals the long-awaited unification of the religious and political life of #Y_0# in the promised land.

-- #X_0# --
The grandson of Abraham, #X_0# is the third patriarch of the Israelite people and the father of the twelve sons who form the tribes of Israel. #X_0# experiences a life fraught with deception, bewilderment, and change. He steals his brother Esau’s inheritance right and wrestles with #Y_0# on the banks of the Jabbok River. Appropriately, the nation that springs from #X_0#’s children derives its name from #X_0#’s #Y_0#-given name, “Israel.” “Israel” means “struggles with #Y_0#,” and #X_0#’s struggles are emblematic of the tumultuous story of the nation of Israel.

-- #X_0# --
Jacob’s son and the head official for the Pharaoh of Egypt. Despite being sold into slavery by his brothers, #X_0# rises to power in Egypt and saves his family from famine. #X_0#’s calm and gracious response to his brothers’ betrayal introduces the pattern of forgiveness and redemption that characterizes the survival of the Israelite people throughout the  Old Testament.

-- #X_0# --
Israel’s first king. After God chooses #X_0# to be king, #X_0# loses his divine right to rule Israel by committing two religious errors. #X_0# acts as a character foil to David, because his plot to murder David only highlights David’s mercy to #X_0# in return. #X_0#’s inner turmoil over the inscrutability of God’s exacting standards makes him a sympathetic but tragic figure.

-- #X_0# --
David’s son and the third king of Israel. #X_0# builds the opulent #Y_1# in #Y_0# and ushers in Israel’s greatest period of wealth and power. God grants #X_0# immense powers of knowledge and discernment in response to #X_0#’s humble request for wisdom. #X_0#’s earthly success hinders his moral living, however, and his weakness for foreign women and their deities leads to Israel’s downfall.

-- #X_0# --
The prophets who oppose the worship of the god Baal in #Y_0#. After the division of #Y_0# into two kingdoms, #X_0# and his successor, #X_0#, represent the last great spiritual heroes before #Y_0#’s exile. Their campaign in northern #Y_0# against King Ahab and Jezebel helps to lessen #Y_0#’s growing evil but does not restore #Y_0#’s greatness. #Y_0#’s demise makes #X_0# and #X_0# frustrated doomsayers and miracle workers rather than national leaders or saviors.

-- #X_0# --
The first man and woman created by God. #X_0# and #X_0# introduce human evil into the world when they eat the fruit of a tree God has forbidden them to touch.

-- #X_0# --
The survivor of God’s great flood. #X_0# obediently builds the large ark, or boat, that saves the human race and the animal kingdom from destruction. #X_0# is the precursor to #X_1#, because #X_0# represents the first instance of God’s attempt to form a covenant with humanity through one person.

-- #X_0# --
Abraham’s son and the second member in the triumvirate of Israel’s patriarchs. #X_0#’s importance consists less in his actions than in the way he is acted upon by others. God tests Abraham by commanding him to kill his son #X_0#, and #X_0#’s blindness and senility allow his own son Jacob to steal #X_0#’s blessing and the inheritance of God’s covenant.

-- #X_0# --
Moses’s brother, who assists Moses in leading the Israelites out of Egypt. God designates #X_0# to be the first high priest in Israel. The quiet #X_0# often stands between Moses and the people to soften Moses’s angry response to their sinful behavior.

-- #X_0# --
The successor of Moses as #Y_0#’s leader. #X_0# directs the people in their sweeping military campaign to conquer and settle the Promised Land. #X_0#’s persistent exhortations to #Y_0# to remain obedient to God imply that he doubts #Y_0# will do so. His exhortations foreshadow #Y_0#’s future religious struggles.

-- #X_0# --
One of Israel’s judges and an epic hero who thwarts the neighboring Philistines with his superhuman strength. #X_0# is rash, belligerent, and driven by lust for foreign women—qualities that contradict Jewish religious ideals. #X_0#’s long hair is both the source of his strength and the symbol of his religious devotion to God as a Nazirite. #X_0#’s character demonstrates that in the bible, heroic potential is gauged not by human excellence but by faith in God.

-- #X_0# --
The last of Israel’s judges and the prophet who anoints both #X_1# and David as king. #X_0# fulfills political and priestly duties for Israel, but he ushers in Israel’s monarchy mainly as a prophet—one who pronounces God’s words and decisions. #X_0#’s stoic and aloof position in Israel allows #X_1# to struggle with God and his fate on his own.

-- #X_0# --
David’s son, who attempts to overthrow his father’s throne. #X_0#’s violent rise to power suggests that the evil that corrupts Israel comes from within.

-- #X_0# --
King #X_2#’s loyal military commander. #X_0# serves as a foil to #X_2#’s successful combination of religion and politics. #X_0#’s reasonable desire to see justice and retribution delivered to the kingdom’s traitors emphasizes the unusual quality of #X_2#’s kindness to his enemies.

-- #X_0# --
The opposing kings who divide Israel into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. #X_0# and #X_0# introduce rampant worship of idols and false gods into their kingdoms. Each king acts both as a point of contrast and a double, or mirror, for the other, allowing the biblical reader to trace the rapid growth of evil in Israel’s two kingdoms.

-- #X_0# --
The most wicked rulers of Israel. #X_0# and #X_0# spread cult worship of the pagan god Baal throughout the northern kingdom. Dogs gather to eat their blood at their deaths, fulfilling Elijah’s prophecy.

-- #X_0# --
A timid Jewish girl who becomes the queen of #Y_0#. #X_0# boldly and cunningly persuades the king of #Y_0# to remove his edict calling for the death of the exiled Jews.

-- #X_0# --
The subject of God and #X_1#’s cosmic experiment to measure human faithfulness to God in the midst of immense pain. #X_0# scorns false contrition and the advice of his friends, preferring instead to question God’s role in human suffering. He retains an open and inquisitive mind, remaining faithful in his refusal to curse God.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s protagonist. #X_0# is an orphan born in a workhouse, and #X_1# uses his situation to criticize public policy toward the poor in 1830s #Y_0#. #X_0# is between nine and twelve years old when the main action of the novel occurs. Though treated with cruelty and surrounded by coarseness for most of his life, he is a pious, innocent child, and his charms draw the attention of several wealthy benefactors. His true identity is the central mystery of the novel.

-- #X_0# --
A conniving career criminal. #X_0# takes in homeless children and trains them to pick pockets for him. He is also a buyer of other people’s stolen goods. He rarely commits crimes himself, preferring to employ others to commit them—and often suffer legal retribution—in his place. #X_1#’s portrait of #X_0# displays the influence of anti-Semitic stereotypes.

-- #X_0# --
A young prostitute and one of #X_2#’s former child pickpockets. #X_0# is also #X_1# lover. Her love for #X_5# and her sense of moral decency come into conflict when #X_5# abuses #X_4#. Despite her criminal lifestyle, she is among the noblest characters in the novel. In effect, she gives her life for #X_4# when #X_5# murders her for revealing #X_3#’s plots.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# sister, raised by Mrs. #X_0# after the death of #X_0#’s father. A beautiful, compassionate, and forgiving young woman, #X_0# is the novel’s model of female virtue. She establishes a loving relationship with #X_3# even before it is revealed that the two are related.

-- #X_0# --
A well-off, erudite gentleman who serves as #X_3#’s first benefactor. #X_0# owns a portrait of #X_1# and was engaged to #X_0# #X_2#’s sister when she died. Throughout the novel, he behaves with compassion and common sense and emerges as a natural leader.

-- #X_0# --
A sickly, vicious young man, prone to violent fits and teeming with inexplicable hatred. With #X_1#, he schemes to give #X_2# a bad reputation.

-- #X_0# --
A brutal professional burglar brought up in #X_1#’s gang. #X_3# is #X_2#'s pimp and lover, and he treats both her and his dog Bull’s-eye with an odd combination of cruelty and grudging affection. His murder of #X_2# is the most heinous of the many crimes that occur in the novel.

-- #X_0# --
The pompous, self-important beadle—a minor church official—for the workhouse where #X_2# is born. Though #X_0#preaches Christian morality, he behaves without compassion toward the paupers under his care. #X_1# mercilessly satirizes his self-righteousness, greed, hypocrisy, and folly, of which his name is an obvious symbol.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s mother. After falling in love with and becoming pregnant by Mr. #X_1#, she chooses to die anonymously in a workhouse rather than stain her family’s reputation. A retired naval officer’s daughter, she was a beautiful, loving woman. #X_2#’s face closely resembles hers.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4# and #X_3#’s father, who dies long before the events of the novel. He was an intelligent, high-minded man whose family forced him into an unhappy marriage with a wealthy woman. He eventually separated from his wife and had an illicit love affair with #X_1# Fleming. He intended to flee the country with #X_1# but died before he could do so.

-- #X_0# --
Mrs. #X_1#’s family physician. A hot-tempered but good-hearted old bachelor, #X_0# is fiercely loyal to the #X_1#s and, eventually, to #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
A kind, wealthy older woman, the mother of Harry #X_0# and adoptive “aunt” of #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
Mrs. #X_0#’s son. #X_0# is a dashing young man with grand political ambitions and career prospects, which he eventually gives up to marry #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# cleverest of #X_2#’s pickpockets. #X_0# #X_0#’s real name is #X_3#. Though no older than #X_4#, the #X_0# talks and dresses like a grown man. He introduces #X_4# to #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#’s pickpockets. #X_0# is ready to laugh at anything.

-- #X_0# --
An elderly pauper who serves as the nurse at #X_3#’s birth. #X_0# steals #X_2#’s gold locket, the only clue to #X_3#’s identity.

-- #X_0# --
The matron of the workhouse where #X_3# is born. #X_0# is hypocritical, callous, and materialistic. After she marries Mr. #X_2#, she hounds him mercilessly.

-- #X_0# --
A charity boy and Mr. #X_3#’s apprentice. #X_0# is an overgrown, cowardly bully who mistreats #X_2# and eventually joins #X_1#’s gang.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_2#’ maid. #X_0# becomes romantically involved with #X_1# and follows him about slavishly.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1# and #X_3#’s associates, crass and not too bright. #X_0# participates in the attempted burglary of Mrs. #X_2#’s home.

-- #X_0# --
Mr. #X_1#’s kindhearted housekeeper. #X_0# is unwilling to believe Mr. #X_2#’s negative report of #X_3#’s character.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# dog. As vicious as his master, #X_0# functions as #X_2#’s alter ego.

-- #X_0# --
An heiress who lived a decadent life and alienated her husband, Mr. #X_1#. #X_0# destroyed Mr. #X_1#’s will, which left part of his property to #X_3#. Much of #X_0# nastiness is presumably inherited from her.

-- #X_0# --
The undertaker to whom #X_2# is apprenticed. Though #X_0#makes a grotesque living arranging cut-rate burials for paupers, he is a decent man who is kind to #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s wife. #X_0# is a mean, judgmental woman who henpecks her husband.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s pessimistic, curmudgeonly friend. #X_0# is essentially good-hearted, and his pessimism is mostly just a provocative character quirk.

-- #X_0# --
Mrs. #X_1#’s loyal, though somewhat pompous, butler.

-- #X_0# --
A sort of handyman for Mrs. #X_1#’s estate. It is implied that #X_0# is slightly mentally handicapped.

The harsh, irrational, power-hungry magistrate who presides over #X_1#’s trial for pickpocketing.

One of #X_2#’s criminal associates. Like #X_2#, #X_0# is Jewish.

-- #X_0# --
Two bumbling police officers who investigate the attempted burglary of Mrs. #X_2#’s home.

-- #X_0# --
A rather dim member of #X_1#’s gang. #X_0# has served time in jail for doing #X_1#’s bidding.

-- #X_0# --
The decent, soft-spoken captain of the #Y_0#n nuclear submarine. Although #X_0# is considered a practical, rational man, he continues to believe—or at least pretend to believe—that his family is still alive in nuclear-war- ravaged #Y_0#. Work is #X_0#'s salvation, and he continues to work hard whether he has to or not. He refuses to break rules, and remains loyal to the #Y_1# and his wife until the end of his life.

A magician who has already lived the future, so he knows what is going to happen next. #X_0# is #X_1#’s tutor and friend. #X_1#’s creation of #Y_1# and a more civilized #Y_0# is largely due to #X_0#’s influence. Although #X_0# is powerful, he is also kind and a little absentminded.

In the novel, a page whom #X_1# asks to carry on the #X_1#ian ideals of justice. In real life, #X_0# wrote the fifteenth-century text Le Morte d’#X_1#, an account of the #X_1#ian legends that served as the basis for #X_3#’s novel.

-- #X_0# --
An inmate of a #Y_0# labor camp somewhere in Siberia in 1951. #X_0# is the novel’s protagonist. He is a working-class, somewhat uneducated man, and his daily struggle represents that of the average Russian citizen. He believes in God but is not religious. His conversation with #X_2# at the end of the novel, however, shows that he may experience a turn to spirituality, when for the first time he does someone a favor without hope of payback.

-- #X_0# --
The foreman of #Y_0#. #X_0# is a strict but fair man who illustrates how the job of prison camp officer can be isolating. #X_0#’s transformation at the #Y_1# work site is one of the most emotional moments in the novel, since we stop despising him as a cold-hearted law enforcer and start sympathizing with him as a victim of injustice.

-- #X_0# --
A fellow prisoner in Gang 104 of uncertain national background and mysterious connections. #X_0# receives regular food parcels that make him the envy of the gang. He is worldly, a man of cultivated artistic interests and luxurious tastes. He represents cultural attainments, abundance, and privilege, values that #X_2# begins to question at the novel’s end.

-- #X_0# --
A fellow prisoner, and the scrounger and wheedler of Gang 104, always nagging for a cigarette or an extra bit of bread from the other inmates. #X_1# scorns #X_0#, but in the end pities him when the guards beat up #X_0# as punishment for licking bowls in the mess hall. #X_0# represents the degradation to which prisoners in the labor camp are capable of slipping if they let go of their human dignity.

-- #X_0# --
A prisoner with a bunk that neighbors #X_1#’s. #X_0# is a devout Baptist who reads late at night in the notebook into which he has copied half of the New Testament. #X_0# is known for doing favors for other inmates but never expecting or receiving rewards for these favors. By the end of the novel, #X_1# begins to respect #X_0#’s naïve goodwill, faith, and disdain of worldly goods.

-- #X_0# --
The deputy foreman of Gang 104. The Ukrainian #X_0#is strict but kind. His patience and mercy toward the inmates earn him the devotion of many members of the gang, including #X_2#, who notes that a prisoner will not work hard for a distant boss but will break his back for a foreman he admires.

-- #X_0# --
A medical orderly and novice poet. #X_0# is vaguely sympathetic toward the sick #X_1#, but has little understanding of #X_1#’s situation. #X_2#’s description of #X_0# as an insensitive poet suggests his disdain for old-fashioned literary types who fail to appreciate real-world problems.

-- #X_0# --
A prisoner known familiarly throughout the novel as “the captain” for his former military rank. In the prison camp, #X_0# is no more privileged than #X_1#. He is well-educated, as demonstrated by his theoretical discussions with #X_2# about Russian films. But his culture is of little service to him in the camp, as the only thing that truly matters is survival.

-- #X_0# --
A sixteen-year-old boy in prison for providing milk to nationalist rebels hiding in the forest. #X_0# is fresh and innocent, and has not yet been hardened by camp life. That the Soviet government has imprisoned one so young and well intentioned illustrates the regime’s utter lack of human compassion.

-- #X_0# --
One of the two Estonians who share a bunk in #X_2#’s hut. #X_0# and the other Estonian chat in their own language constantly, interacting with each other much more than with anyone else. The Estonians represent the necessity of maintaining a private world set apart from the horrors of camp existence.

-- #X_0# --
Another foreigner among the camp inmates. #X_0# is a Latvian bricklayer and #X_1#’s colleague at #Y_0#, and is famed for his sense of humor. #X_1#’s comment that #X_0#’s sense of humor stems from his regular receiving of food parcels demonstrates the relationship between the basic necessities of life (such as food) and happiness.

-- #X_0# --
A prison warden who warns #X_2# that some of his men still have not completed their written explanations of why they possessed forbidden goods.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. #X_0# is the son of the chief of the Columbia Indians and a white woman. He suffers from paranoia and hallucinations, has received multiple electroshock treatments, and has been in the hospital for ten years, longer than any other patient in the ward. #X_0# sees modern society as a huge, oppressive conglomeration that he calls the #Y_0# and the hospital as a place meant to fix people who do not conform. #X_0# chronicles the story of the mental ward while developing his perceptual abilities and regaining a sense of himself as an individual.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s protagonist. #X_0# is a big, redheaded gambler, a con man, and a backroom boxer. His body is heavily scarred and tattooed, and he has a fresh scar across the bridge of his nose. He was sentenced to six months at a prison work farm, and when he was diagnosed as a psychopath—for “too much fighting and fucking”—he did not protest because he thought the hospital would be more comfortable than the work farm. #X_0# serves as the unlikely #X_1# figure in the novel—the dominant force challenging the establishment and the ultimate savior of the victimized patients.

-- #X_0# --
The head of the hospital ward. #X_0#, the novel’s antagonist, is a middle-aged former army nurse. She rules her ward with an iron hand and masks her humanity and femininity behind a stiff, patronizing facade. She selects her staff for their submissiveness, and she weakens her patients through a psychologically manipulative program designed to destroy their self-esteem. #X_0#’s emasculating, mechanical ways slowly drain all traces of humanity from her patients.

-- #X_0# --
An acerbic, college-educated patient and president of #Y_0#. #X_0# helps #X_2# understand the realities of the hospital. Although he is married, #X_0# is a homosexual. He has difficulty dealing with the overwhelming social prejudice against homosexuals, so he hides in the hospital voluntarily. #X_0#’s development and the reemergence of his individual self signal the success of #X_2#’s battle against #X_3#, especially when #X_0# checks himself out of the ward and paves the way for the other cured patients to leave.

-- #X_0# --
A shy patient. #X_0# has a bad stutter and seems much younger than his thirty-one years. #X_0# is dominated by his mother, one of Nurse #X_1#’s close friends. #X_0# is voluntarily in the hospital, as he is afraid of the outside world.

-- #X_0# --
A mild-mannered doctor who may be addicted to opiates. Nurse #X_3# chose #X_0# as the doctor for her ward because he is as easily cowed and dominated as the patients. With #X_2#’s arrival, he, like the patients, begins to assert himself. He often supports #X_2#’s unusual plans for the ward, such as holding a carnival.

-- #X_0# --
The first patient to support #X_1#’s rebellion against Nurse #X_2#’s power. #X_0#, a man of much talk and little action, drowns in the pool—possibly a suicide—after #X_1# does not support #X_0# when #X_0# takes a stand against Nurse #X_2#. #X_0#’s death is significant in that it awakens #X_1# to the extent of his influence and the mistake of his decision to conform.

-- #X_0# --
Hospital aides. #X_0# #X_0# and #X_5# are #X_1#’s daytime aides; #X_0# is the nighttime aide. #X_1# hired them because they are filled with hatred and will submit to her wishes completely.

-- #X_0# --
A beautiful, carefree prostitute from #Y_0#. #X_0# accompanies #X_1# and the other patients on the fishing trip, and then comes to the ward for a late-night party that #X_1# arranges.

-- #X_0# --
A hospital patient, a big Swede, and a former seaman. #X_1# recruits #X_0# to be captain for the fishing excursion. He is nicknamed “Rub-a-Dub #X_0#” by the aides because he has an intense phobia toward dirtiness. #X_1#’s defense of #X_0# leads #X_1# to his first electroshock treatment.

-- #X_0# --
A hospital patient who suffered brain damage when he was born. #X_0# continually declares that he is tired, and at one point he tells the other patients that he was born dead.

-- #X_0# --
Another hospital patient. #X_0# lives in a world of delusional hallucinations, but #X_1# includes him in the board and card games with the other patients.

-- #X_0# --
A patient who is a vegetable. #X_1# has a prophetic dream about a mechanical slaughterhouse in which #X_0# is murdered. He wakes up to discover that #X_0# died in the night.

-- #X_0# --
A patient who was once an Acute. #X_0#’s excessive electroshock therapy transformed him into a Chronic. In the daytime, he is nailed to the wall. He frequently urinates on himself.

-- #X_0# --
A patient and a former football player. #X_0# was committed to the ward eight years ago. He often experiences hallucinations. #X_0# reveals a key fact to #X_1#—that committed patients can leave only when #X_2# permits—which changes #X_1#’s initial rebelliousness into temporary conformity.

-- #X_0# --
A prostitute who knows #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A Chronic patient. #X_0#, like #X_1#, was once an Acute, but was transformed into a Chronic due to a botched lobotomy.

-- #X_0# --
The only Acute besides #X_1# who was involuntarily committed to the hospital. #X_0# has fantasies of blowing things up.

-- #X_0# --
Epileptic patients. #X_0# hates to take his medications because they make his teeth fall out, so he gives them to #X_0#, who likes to take #X_0#’s dose in addition to his own. Although #X_0# require more medical care than some of the other nonmedicated patients, they still do not receive much care or attention by the staff, who are much more concerned with making the disorderly patients orderly.

-- #X_0# --
The black nighttime orderly for Nurse #X_2#’s ward. #X_0# is kind to #X_1#, untying the sheets that confine him to his bed at night, and he goes along with the nighttime ward party.

-- #X_0# --
A former patient who stayed in Nurse #X_2#’s ward before #X_1# arrived. When #X_0# questioned the nurse’s authority, she punished him with electroshock therapy. After the treatments made him completely docile, he was allowed to leave the hospital. He is considered a successful cure by the hospital staff.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_1#’s father, also known as #X_2# Tallest on the Mountain, is chief of the Columbia Indians. He married a Caucasian woman and took her last name. She made him feel small and drove him to alcoholism. The chief’s marriage and submission to a white woman makes an important statement about the oppression of the natural order by modern society and also reflects white society’s encroachment on Native Americans.

-- #X_0# --
A fat, bald bureaucrat who wears a girdle. #X_0# leads tours of the ward, pointing out that it is nice and pleasant.

-- #X_0# --
A strict Catholic with a prominent birthmark on her face that she attempts to scrub away. #X_0# is afraid of the patients’ sexuality.

-- #X_0# --
A patient on the Disturbed ward. #X_0# commits suicide by cutting off his testicles. This actual castration symbolizes the psychological emasculation to which the patients are routinely subjected.

-- #X_0# --
One of the themes of One Hundred Years of Solitude is the way history repeats itself in cycles. In this novel, each generation is condemned to repeat the mistakes—and to celebrate the triumphs—of the previous generation. To dramatize this point, #X_4# has given his protagonists, the #X_3# family members, a very limited selection of names. One Hundred Years of Solitude spans six generations, and in each generation, the men of the #X_3# line are named José #X_0#rcadio or #X_0#ureliano and the women are named #X_10#, #X_0#maranta, or #X_9#. Telling the difference between people who have the same name can sometimes be difficult. To a certain extent, this is to be expected: after all, #X_4#’s point is precisely that human nature does not really change, that the #X_3# family is locked into a cycle of repetitions. To preserve a clear notion of the plot progression, however, it is important to pay attention to the full names of the protagonists, which often contain slight distinguishing variations. José #X_0#rcadio #X_3#, for instance, is a very different character than his son, José #X_0#rcadio: although it is true that José #X_0#rcadio’s last name is also “#X_3#,” he is never referred to, either by #X_4# or in this Spark#X_0#, as anything but “José #X_0#rcadio.” #X_0#nd so on.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# patriarch of the #X_0# clan, #X_3# #X_0# is #Y_0#’s founder and its most charismatic citizen. He is a man of great strength and curiosity. Impulsively, he embarks on mad pursuits of esoteric and practical knowledge, and it is his solitary and obsessive quest for knowledge that drives him mad at the end of his life; he spends many years, in the end, tied to a tree in the #X_0# backyard, speaking Latin that only the priest understands. #X_3# #X_0# is married to #X_5# and the father of #X_3#, Colonel Aureliano #X_0#, and #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The novel's protagonist, #X_0# is a model of emotional strength, courage, and resolve. As the eldest child of the Swedish immigrant John #X_0#, she inherits his farm and makes it profitable.

-- #X_0# --
The youngest son of John #X_0#, and the younger brother of #X_6#, #X_4#, and #X_1#. #X_0# reaps the advantages of #X_1#'s financial success: freed from the obligations of farm work, he is able to go to college and explore the world.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The second son of John #X_0#, and the brother of #X_1#, #X_6#, and #X_4#. #X_0# is relatively intelligent, but he is also devious, small-minded, and vicious. He marries #X_2# and settles into a life of scheming and small-time politics. He is less creative and flexible than #X_1#, and, like his older brother #X_6#, he resents the relationship between #X_1# and #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The oldest son of John #X_0#, the younger brother of #X_1#, and the older brother of #X_5# and #X_3#. #X_0# is a hard worker, but mentally sluggish and uncreative. Like his smarter brother #X_5#, he resents #X_1# for her financial success, her unconventional ways, and her relationship with #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The patriarch of the #X_0# clan, father of #X_1#, #X_4#, #X_3#, and #X_2#. #X_0# had been a shipwright in #Y_1#, but became a farmer in the untamed, hardscrabble prairie lands of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# wife. #X_0# is a sharp, aggressive, petty woman who is obsessed with appearances. She is as intent as her husband on securing #X_1#'s farm as an inheritance for their children. She is the mother of the charming and decent #X_3#, who becomes #X_1#'s favorite niece.

-- #X_0# --
Despite #X_1#'s dislike for her sister-in-law, #X_2# #X_0#, she has great affection for #X_2#'s elderly mother. #X_0#spends a long yearly visit in #X_1#'s house, where she appreciates the reverence for old Swedish tradition.

-- #X_0# --
The novel's narrator. #X_0# retells her life from when she is seven years old to an unspecified time after her teenage years. #X_0# is a sincerely devout child who earnestly believes in God and love. As #X_0# grows into her teenage years, she falls in love with another girl. Eventually, she realizes that her same sex love is part of her nature that cannot be denied. Although others categorize #X_0# as evil, #X_0# maintains an impression of goodness and even sacrifice. #X_0# is the novel's mythic heroine. Her quest is for her true self. In her community of religious hypocrisy, #X_0# represents truth and spirit.

-- #X_0# --
A fundamentalist Christian woman. #X_0#adopted #X_1# because she wanted to train her daughter to be a servant of God. #X_0#is combative and controlling. #X_0#often appears to be hypocritical. She keeps a wine glass in her house for "medicinal purposes," yet criticizes the "#Y_0#" for drinking. She professes to be very religious, but often acts in uncharitable ways. #X_0#represents the rigid unbending establishment of the church. #X_0#also represents the hypocrisy inherent in members of the church.

-- #X_0# --
A member of the church, #X_0#is energetic, outgoing, and entertaining. #X_0# is a very devout member of the church who testifies daily. Despite her genuine religiousness, she is also quite eccentric. Her past has involved traveling outside of #Y_0# to such places as #Y_1#. She appears to be another live soul amid the congregation that is full of unthinking, spiritless practitioners. #X_0#represents the possibility of the imagination and the world outside of #X_2#'s small circle. #X_0# also serves as a loving mother figure to #X_2# when #X_2#'s own mother is neglectful.

-- #X_0# --
A member of #X_2#'s church who plays the oboe. #X_0# represents the closeted lesbian that #X_2# refuses to become. #X_0#'s character is awkward, slightly unfriendly, and generally disdained by others who deem her unholy, because of her latent sexual desires. Still, #X_0#'s inability to choose either her lesbianism or her religion leaves her as a character torn between two contradictory worlds. She can never live with a full identity. After #X_2# has liberated herself by choosing her sexuality over her community, she declines to visit #X_0# who lacked the courage to make a similar choice.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s first lover. #X_1# meets #X_0# at a fish stand. #X_0#'s character is sweet, docile, and not too smart. Initially, #X_0# tells #X_1# that she got her name because her head resembled a melon— a wry comment also upon #X_0#'s limited intellectual capacity. #X_0#'s docility leads her to later marry, have children, and deny that she ever had a lesbian love. #X_0# represents another weak soul who refuses to follow her true desires and venture outside of the role society has placed upon her, unlike #X_1#. Her weak characters helps to highlight the strength of #X_1#'s.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s second long term lover. #X_0#'s character is confident, open, and unashamed. #X_0#'s obviously sexual invitation to #X_1# demonstrates to #X_1# a new confidence about same sex relations. #X_0# contrasts with the character of #X_2# in that #X_0# understands what she is doing with #X_1#, but lacks any shame about her behavior. Not surprisingly, their confidence and happiness leads to their being caught. Still while they are caught, the capture differs greatly from the time that #X_2# and #X_1# were found out. #X_0# has helped to instill #X_1# with confidence in her self and her sexuality.

-- #X_0# --
Married to #X_0# mother. #X_0# almost is never mentioned in the novel. He works in a factory and leaves for work at five in the morning. He and #X_0# mother do not have sex. #X_1# #X_0# plays a non- existent role in governing the household and dealing with #X_1#. His absence in the household is the most important thing about him. It demonstrates that #X_1# grew up in a primarily matriarchal household.

-- #X_0# --
A very religious member of #X_1#'s church. As her name indicates, #X_0# appears to be of the utmost purity. With #X_1#'s mother, she represents one of the church members who holds very unbending ideas about sin and goodness. The narrator frequently uses #X_0#'s allegedly purity for comic effect. While #X_0# is supposedly devout, she grabs a wine glass to better eavesdrop on the fornication at the next-door neighbors, an act of a gossip rather than a saint. Further, #X_0#'s eventual difficulty in breathing because of her proximity to a lesbian seems ludicrous.

-- #X_0# --
One of the lesbian women who owns the paper shop. #X_0#presence foreshadows #X_2#'s eventual sexual identity. #X_0#also acts as one of the few people in the narrative who follows her own inclinations. Her presence helps #X_2#'s latent feelings come to light. Significantly, #X_0#is present on the day that #X_2# meets #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The pastor who converted #X_1#'s mother and whom she idolizes. #X_1# and her mother frequently discuss his crusades in the tropics. #X_0# infrequently acts in the narrative, but his presence pervades #X_1#'s mother's life. He symbolizes the extreme elements in the church.

-- #X_0# --
Ex-lover of #X_2#'s mother with whom she had sexual relations. His name evokes the passion that #X_2#'s mother once had, but since has lost. References to him frequently dot the text whenever the themes of romance or sin appear.

-- #X_0# --
Visiting minister to #X_1#'s church. His name suggests that he is resembles a songbird who simply repeats the tunes taught to him. #X_0# is a comic character who unleashes a fiery sermon about the dangers of being seven to #X_1#. The seriousness of his sermon compared to #X_1#'s innocence of age renders him ridiculous.

-- #X_0# --

A year later, #X_0# tried to commit suicide but failed, forcing him to spend time in hospital. At the beginning of the novel, he has been out of the hospital for a month. He is trying to get his life back on track, but he feels little purpose in life and no motivation. He begins to see Dr. #X_1# to help him recover from the traumatic events he has experienced. Over the course of the novel, he begins a steady relationship with #X_5# and rebuilds some of his old friendships.

-- #X_0# --

The wife of #X_1# and mother of #X_2#, #X_0# spends most of her time playing golf and working around the home. Although she is troubled by the horrible events she has experienced with her sons, she wants to move on without dwelling on the past at all, an attitude that brings her into conflict with #X_1#, who thinks that the family needs to talk through the past. At the end of the novel, she leaves #X_1# and #X_2# for an indefinite period, although there is no talk of an official divorce.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# only appears in flashbacks. He was the oldest child of #X_4# and #X_2#. He died in a boating accident, an event for which #X_5# has never forgiven himself. Like #X_5#, he was on the swimming team, and he shared many friends in common with #X_5#.

The protagonist of the novel, #X_0# is a wealthy nobleman who is adventurous and artistic. Based on #X_3#'s real-life love interest #X_1#, #X_0# (like #X_2#) has values deeply rooted in his home and in his long and noble ancestry. By changing genders halfway through the novel (from male to female) #X_0# is able to reflect upon the differing positions and experiences of each gender. S/he is a reflective individual, who longs both for life and for love, and finds in poetry one of her greatest satisfactions. #X_0# does not feel constrained by any time but the present, which frightens her in its potential for danger. It is in the present that #X_0# realizes herself to be composed of not one, but many selves. Together, these selves and experiences combined with her love of nature, allow #X_0# to find composure and confidence as one individual.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a Russian princess, a Muscovite, who travels by ship to #Y_1# to the court of King #X_1# Her language and her demeanor makes her appear mysterious to the men of the #Y_0#, but her fluency in French allows her to converse freely with #X_2#. When #X_2# first catches sight of her, he is unable to tell whether she is a man or a woman. Her height and clothes make her appear androgynous, but #X_2# is overcome her seductive nature. Deceitful, #X_0# uses #X_2# to entertain her while in #Y_2#, and then she runs away with a Russian seaman, breaking #X_2#'s heart. The memory of #X_0#'s mysteriousness and seductiveness remains with #X_2# as long as he lives.

-- #X_0# --
A brave, gallant seaman, #X_0#sweeps #X_1# off her feet in the nineteenth century when he sees her hurt on the moor. #X_0#is in love with #X_1# and hastens to marry her, but he, like many fictional Victorian heroes, is torn between love for a woman and his duty as a seaman. When the wind changes, he must return to his ship to sail around Cape Horn. #X_0#is loved by #X_1# as well. He and #X_1# are unique since they have many qualities of the opposite sexes. The narrator notes that he is "as strange and subtle as a woman," yet he commits the heroic acts of a man.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# #X_0# who #X_2# first sees riding on a horse through the courtyards of his home, is really a very tall man who dresses as a woman because he is in love with #X_2# (as a man). He is a #Y_1#n archduke of #Y_0# and Scand-op-Boom, and he asks #X_2# to marry him and come away with him to #Y_1#. As a character, he is ridiculous, a parody of heroes in novels who fall madly in love and do silly things to have their love requited. The #X_0# is also quite slow; #X_2# must cheat at a game they play over twenty times in order for him to catch her. #X_0# is traditional; he seeks a wife to live with him in his home, and he is appalled that a woman would cheat at a game. He plays a very comic role in the novel.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# #X_0# appears twice in the novel, once as a seventeenth-century poet who writes a parody of #X_3#, and later as the most eminent Victorian (nineteenth-century) literary critic. But though times have changed, #X_1# does not change much at all. He is forever complaining about how the high-point of English literature has passed and how the authors of the current moment care only about money. He is generally an unhappy man, completely enraptured by his own ill-health. #X_0# is a perpetual literary critic who can tear down the work of others, but creates nothing of very much importance himself. Because he lives deep in the world of fame and good reviews, #X_0# is able to get #X_3#'s work published and made famous.

-- #X_0# --
In real life, Alexander #X_0#, a poet of the eighteenth-century, was famous for his polemical satires and mock-epics, "The Dunciad" and "The Rape of the Lock." In the novel, #X_2# places #X_0# on a pedestal when she meets him at a gathering of "brilliant" people. When #X_0# is the only one to say truly witty things at the gathering, #X_2# becomes enraptured by him and the fact that he is a writer. But the description of him is quite unflattering, "he looked like some squat reptile set with a burning topaz in his forehead." #X_2# finds that #X_0# is a regular person, driven by petty jealousies, praise, and ego, like every other writer.

-- #X_0# --
The old gypsy man of the tribe in the hills of #Y_0#, #X_0# welcomes #X_1# into the tribe, but later distrusts her when he finds her beliefs differ so much from those of the gypsies. As a gypsy with no "official" property or ancestry, but whose lineage stretches back thousands of years (far further than #X_1#'s), #X_0# cannot see the point in taking pride in a house of 365 bedrooms. To him, such a thing is worthless because it is not necessary. He does not see nature for its beauty (like #X_1#) but for its potential to do danger. Ultimately, he functions in the novel to give #X_1# perspective on her English values.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0# is a noble, older woman who is very accustomed to having power and control. She takes likes #X_2# for his youthful, innocent look, something she longs to regain for herself. After she makes #X_2# her Treasurer, Steward, and lover, she grows possessive of him. Her nature will not allow her to accept that she should be tossed aside for another. Violently jealous, #X_0# cannot handle that #X_2# would choose another lover. She dies soon after seeing him with another woman.

-- #X_0# --
A Spanish woman in #Y_0#, #X_0#'s marriage to #X_1# lasts only a day before #X_0# falls into a deep trance. #X_0# does not play a major role in the novel, but the reader learns that she is a Spanish dancer, reputed to be a gypsy, whose mother and father are unknown. Her character is thought to be based on #X_2# grandmother, who was a Spanish dancer.

-- #X_0# --
One of the first women #X_3# dated when he was a member of King #X_2#'s court, #X_0# was a sweet, gentle lady, but her excessive religiosity and her intentions to lead #X_3# from a life of sin, sickened him.

-- #X_0# --
The second of #X_2#'s loves at King #X_1#'s court, #X_0# was the daughter of a poor Somersetshire gentleman. Though #X_0# had excessive grace and was greatly admired at #Y_0#, #X_2# ended their relationship when he saw her whipping a spaniel dog.

-- #X_0# --
The third of #X_1#'s loves at the court of King James, #X_0# would have made the perfect wife of a nobleman. She was fair, sweet, kind to animals, and from an extraordinarily good Irish family. Plans were under way for the marriage between #X_1# and #X_0#, when he decided he preferred to run away with #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the novel. #X_0# is the survivor of a global pandemic, who has been left in charge of a tribe of childlike, genetically enhanced humans that were created by his friend-turned-rival, #X_1#. #X_0# feels lonely and morose as he struggles to survive in post-apocalyptic conditions, and he spends much of his time immersed in memories of his pre-apocalypse life, when his name was #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s longtime friend and rival, and architect of the global pandemic. #X_0#, whose original name was #X_1#, showed early promise in math and science and grew into a genius geneticist. #X_0#’s view of the world was coldly rational and fiercely atheistic, and he pursued ambitious but morally questionable genetic research that eventually led to billions of deaths and the genesis of a new breed of enhanced humans.

-- #X_0# --
The mutual love interest of #X_2# and #X_1#. Originally from a rural village somewhere in south or southeast Asia, #X_0# was sold into slavery at a young age and spent much of her early life working in the sex industry. Despite the numerous traumas of her youth, #X_0# retained an optimistic attitude, which made her an excellent teacher for #X_1#’s genetically modified humans.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother and a former microbiologist. After growing disenchanted with the work she was doing for #Y_1#, #X_0# ran away from her job and family. Although #X_1# only has glimpses of her life after she abandoned him, he knows she joined the activist group #Y_0# and participated in demonstrations against research involving genetic manipulation.

-- #X_0# --
Unnamed. A genetic researcher at #Y_1# and, later, at #Y_0#, #X_0# father was an emotionally distant figure who frequently expressed cold disappointment about his son’s lack of intellectual ability in math and science. He fought frequently with his wife #X_2# about the moral implications of his research, arguing that the research had practical benefits. After his wife ran away, he took up a relationship with his colleague, #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A colleague of #X_1#’s father. #X_0# worked with #X_1#’s father at #Y_1#, and they transferred to #Y_0# together. After #X_1#’s mother ran away, #X_0# started dating #X_1#’s father and eventually married him. #X_0# cared for #X_1# like a mother, and though #X_1# appreciated her kindness, he also resented it. #X_0# continued to write to #X_1# after he moved away, describing her failed attempts to have a child with his father.

-- #X_0# --
Unnamed. #X_0# mother worked a lot and left her son to his own devices, though to #X_2# it appeared that she didn’t care about #X_1#. #X_0# mother died a sudden, violent death after getting exposed to a mysterious virus. #X_1# witnessed her death, and #X_2# later suspected that #X_1# had something to do with it.

-- #X_0# --
Unnamed. #X_0# father worked for #Y_0#, and he discovered that the company actively fabricated new diseases, which it distributed through vitamin pills. After #X_0# father threatened to leak what he knew to the media, the company executed him, but made it look like a suicide.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s stepfather. #X_0# worked for #Y_0#, and he was the supervisor for the division where #X_2#’s father worked. He was a friend of the family, which is why #X_2# called him “uncle.” After #X_2#’s father died, #X_0# married #X_2#’s mother and became his stepfather. #X_2# disliked #X_0#, and #X_3# later suspected that #X_2# was behind #X_0#’s sudden and mysterious death.

-- #X_0# --
The businessman who first purchased #Y_0#. #X_0# bought children from the villages surrounding a major Asian city, then used those children in a variety of money-making schemes, such as selling flowers to tourists.

-- #X_0# --
An American camera operator who worked in the child pornography industry. #X_0# befriended #X_2# and taught her English in exchange for sexual favors.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s college girlfriend. #X_0# was a conceptual artist who made large-scale installations. She used animal parts to spell out words in open outdoor spaces, and she filmed the action when birds of prey descended to “vulturize” her sculptures.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s freshman-year suite mate. #X_0# was a hardcore vegan and feminist who terrorized #X_1# for eating meat and for having an active sex life.

-- #X_0# --
A tribe of genetically enhanced humans created by #X_0#. Also referred to as “#X_0#rs,” the #X_0# represent a new subspecies of Homo sapiens that #X_0# designed to eliminate sexual competition and aggression. #X_0# outfitted the #X_0# with genetic and behavioral features drawn from a variety of other animals. These features enable them to survive in the post-apocalyptic world. Although they each have a name, #X_1# has a hard time telling them apart due to a lack of distinguishing personality traits.

-- #X_0# --
The budding leader of the Children of #X_2#. Though each of the #X_2#rs has a name based on a historical figure, #X_0# is the only one #X_4# recognizes, because he frequently speaks on the #X_2#rs’ behalf. #X_2# wanted his new breed of humans to live in a nonhierarchical society that lacked leaders, and #X_4# recognizes that #X_0#’s leader-like qualities go against #X_2#’s design.

-- #X_0# --
The play’s protagonist and hero. A Christian Moor and general of the armies of #Y_0#, #X_0# is an eloquent and physically powerful figure, respected by all those around him. In spite of his elevated status, he is nevertheless easy prey to insecurities because of his age, his life as a soldier, and his race. He possesses a “free and open nature,” which his ensign #X_2# uses to twist his love for his wife, #X_1#, into a powerful and destructive jealousy.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of the Venetian senator #X_1#. #X_0# and #X_3# are secretly married before the play begins. While in many ways stereotypically pure and meek, #X_0# is also determined and self-possessed. She is equally capable of defending her marriage, jesting bawdily with #X_2#, and responding with dignity to #X_3#’s incomprehensible jealousy.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s ensign (a job also known as an ancient or standard-bearer), and the villain of the play. #X_0# is twenty-eight years old. While his ostensible reason for desiring #X_1#’s demise is that he has been passed over for promotion to lieutenant, #X_0#’s motivations are never very clearly expressed and seem to originate in an obsessive, almost aesthetic delight in manipulation and destruction.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s lieutenant. #X_0# is a young and inexperienced soldier, whose high position is much resented by #X_2#. Truly devoted to #X_3#, #X_0# is extremely ashamed after being implicated in a drunken brawl on #Y_0# and losing his place as lieutenant. #X_2# uses #X_0#’s youth, good looks, and friendship with #X_1# to play on #X_3#’s insecurities about #X_1#’s fidelity.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s wife and #X_1#’s attendant. A cynical, worldly woman, she is deeply attached to her mistress and distrustful of her husband.

-- #X_0# --
A jealous suitor of #X_2#. Young, rich, and foolish, #X_0# is convinced that if he gives #X_3# all of his money, #X_3# will help him win #X_2#’s hand. Repeatedly frustrated as #X_4# marries #X_2# and then takes her to #Y_0#, #X_0# is ultimately desperate enough to agree to help #X_3# kill #X_1# after #X_3# points out that #X_1# is another potential rival for #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A courtesan, or prostitute, in #Y_0#. #X_0#’s favorite customer is #X_1#, who teases her with promises of marriage.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s father, a somewhat blustering and self-important Venetian senator. As a friend of #X_2#, #X_0# feels betrayed when the general marries his daughter in secret.

-- #X_0# --
The official authority in #X_0#, the duke has great respect for #X_2# as a public and military servant. His primary role within the play is to reconcile #X_2# and #X_1# in Act I, scene iii, and then to send #X_2# to #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The governor of #Y_0# before #X_1#. We see him first in Act II, as he recounts the status of the war and awaits the Venetian ships.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#’s kinsmen, #X_0# acts as a messenger from #Y_1# to #Y_0#. He arrives in #Y_0# in Act IV with letters announcing that #X_3# has been replaced by #X_2# as governor.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s kinsman who accompanies #X_3# to #Y_0#. Amidst the chaos of the final scene, #X_0# mentions that #X_2#’s father has died.

-- #X_0# --
Othello’s servant. Although the clown appears only in two short scenes, his appearances reflect and distort the action and words of the main plots: his puns on the word “lie” in Act III, scene iv, for example, anticipate Othello’s confusion of two meanings of that word in Act IV, scene i.

-- #X_0# --
The author of the book and one of its two main subjects. Over the course of the book, #X_0# grows from a troublemaker who rebels against authority into a successful student, soldier, and community leader.

-- #X_0# --
The book’s other subject, a man who shares the author’s name. Although his early life shares similarities with #X_0#’s, #X_0# is hotheaded and defiant, and he falls into a life of violence and crime that ultimately leads him to prison.

-- #X_0# --
The mother of #X_1#, #X_2#, and #X_3#. Determined and strict, #X_0# enrolls #X_1# in military school to protect him from the violence and drugs in their neighborhood and set him on the path for success.

-- #X_0# --
The smart and ambitious mother of #X_2# and #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s older sister. #X_0# is seven years older than #X_1# and looks after him while their mother works.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s younger sister. #X_0# loves reading and does very well in school.

-- #X_0# --
The father of #X_1# and #X_2#. A hard-working reporter and loving father, he dies when #X_1# is three years old.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father and the first Black minister in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s mother. She is strict but loving, and helps raise #X_3# and his siblings in the #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_2#’s. A football player and a jokester, he is one of the few members of #X_2#’s class to graduate from high school.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother. #X_0# promises to support #X_1# as she attends college while raising a baby, but #X_0# dies before #X_1# can graduate.

-- #X_0# --
The first Black mayor of #Y_0#. #X_0# is highly educated and was first elected when he was only 38 years old.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s friend from the Bronx. #X_0# is one of few Black students at #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The mother of #X_2#’s third and fourth children and a heroin addict.

-- #X_0# --
An older student at #Y_0# who commands everyone’s respect.

-- #X_0# --
A #Y_0# police officer and jewelry store security guard killed in robbery.

-- #X_0# --
The host of the play and the dramatic equivalent of an omniscient narrator. The #X_0# exercises control over the action of the play, cueing the other characters, interrupting their scenes with his own interjections, and informing the audience of events and objects that we cannot see. Although referred to only as #X_0# and not by a name, he occasionally assumes other roles, such as an old woman, a druggist, and a minister. Interacting with both the world of the audience and the world of the play’s characters, he occupies a godlike position of authority.

-- #X_0# --
Dr. and Mrs. #X_0#’s son. A decent, upstanding young man, #X_0# is a high school baseball star who plans to attend #Y_0# after high school. His courtship of #X_1# Webb and eventual marriage to her is central to the play’s limited narrative action. #X_3# uses #X_0# and #X_1#’s relationship to ponder the questions of love and marriage in general.

-- #X_0# --
Mr. and Mrs. #X_0#’s daughter and #X_2#’s older sister. #X_0# is #X_1#’s schoolmate and next-door neighbor, then his fiancée, and later his wife. She is an excellent student and a conscientious daughter. After dying in childbirth, #X_0# joins the group of dead souls in the local cemetery and attempts to return to the world of the living. Her realization that human life is precious because it is fleeting is perhaps the central message of the play.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s father and the town doctor. #X_0# #X_2# is also a Civil War expert. His delivery of twins just before the play opens establishes the themes of birth, life, and daily activity. He and his family are neighbors to the #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother and Dr. #X_0#’s wife. #X_0#’s desire to visit #Y_0#—a wish that is never fulfilled—suggests the importance of seizing the opportunities life presents, rather than waiting for things to happen. At the same time, #X_0#’s wish for the luxurious trip ultimately proves unnecessary in her quest to appreciate life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s father and the publisher and editor of #Y_0#. #X_0# #X_2#’s report to the audience in Act I is both informative and interactive, as his question-and-answer session draws the audience physically into the action of the play.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother and Mr. #X_2#’s wife. At first a no-nonsense woman who does not cry on the morning of her daughter’s marriage, #X_0# #X_2# later shows her innocent and caring nature, worrying during the wedding that she has not taught her daughter enough about marriage.

-- #X_0# --
A gossipy woman who sings in the choir along with #X_0# #X_2# and #X_0# #X_1#. #X_0# appears in the group of dead souls in Act III. One of the few townspeople we meet outside of the #X_2# and #X_1# families, #X_0# offers a sense of the interrelated nature of the lives of the citizens of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The choirmaster, whose alcoholism and undisclosed “troubles” have been the subject of gossip in #X_1#’s Corners for quite some time. #X_2# uses Mr. #X_0#’s misfortunes to explore the limitations of small town life. Mr. #X_0# appears in the group of dead souls in Act III, having committed suicide by hanging himself in his attic. He is perhaps most notable for his short speech in Act III, when he says that human existence is nothing but “[i]gnorance and blindness.”

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s younger sister. #X_0#’s role is minor, but she does have one very significant scene with her brother. Her remarks in Act I—about the location of #Y_0# in the universe—articulate an important theme in the play: if the town is a microcosm, representative of the broader human community and the shared human experience, then this human experience of #Y_0# lies at the center of a grand structure and is therefore eternal.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s younger brother. #X_0# is a minor figure, but he turns up in Act III among the group of dead souls. #X_0# dies young, the result of a burst appendix on a #Y_0# trip. His untimely death underscores the brief and fleeting nature of life.

-- #X_0# --
The local milkman. #X_0#’s reappearance during every morning scene—once each in Acts I, II, and III—highlights the continuity of life in #X_1#’s Corners and in the general human experience.

-- #X_0# --

A 57-year-old Black doctor who joins #X_2#’s group of travelers. #X_0# left tragedy in #Y_0# to make his way to Northern California in a parallel journey to #X_2#’s. He’s drawn to #X_2#’s benevolence when witnessing her helping those in need, and eventually falls in love with her despite their age difference. There are noted similarities between himself and Reverend #X_3#, but #X_0#’s experience and historical perspective prove valuable to #X_2# and the group as they navigate an anarchic landscape. As well as being #X_2#’s lover, #X_0# is also her intellectual match.

A 25-year-old white woman rescued by #X_2# and her group. Like her sister #X_1#, #X_0# was also forced into sexual slavery by their father. However, she dies a hero and a martyr for the cause when she’s shot in the back running little #X_3# to safety.

-- #X_0# --
Head of the rebellious angels who have just fallen from Heaven. As the poem’s antagonist, #X_0# is the originator of sin—the first to be ungrateful for God the Father’s blessings. He embarks on a mission to Earth that eventually leads to the fall of #X_1# and #X_2#, but also worsens his eternal punishment. His character changes throughout the poem. #X_0# often appears to speak rationally and persuasively, but later in the poem we see the inconsistency and irrationality of his thoughts. He can assume any form, adopting both glorious and humble shapes.

-- #X_0# --
The first human, the father of our race, and, along with his wife #X_2#, the caretaker of the Garden of Eden. #X_0# is grateful and obedient to God, but falls from grace when #X_2# convinces him to join her in the sin of eating from the Tree of Knowledge.

-- #X_0# --
The first woman and the mother of mankind. #X_0# was made from a rib taken from #X_1#’s side. Because she was made from #X_1# and for #X_1#, she is subservient to him. She is also weaker than #X_1#, so #X_2# focuses his powers of temptation on her. He succeeds in getting her to eat the fruit of the forbidden tree despite God’s command.

-- #X_0# --
One part of the Christian Trinity. #X_0# creates the world by means of #X_0# the Son, creating Adam and #X_1# last. He foresees the fall of mankind through them. He does not prevent their fall, in order to preserve their free will, but he does allow his Son to atone for their sins.

-- #X_0# --
Jesus Christ, the second part of the Trinity. He delivers the fatal blow to Satan’s forces, sending them down into Hell, before the creation of Earth.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s second-in-command. #X_0# discusses with #X_1# their options after being cast into Hell, and at the debate suggests that they investigate the newly created Earth. He and #X_1# embody perverted reason, since they are both eloquent and rational but use their talents for wholly corrupt ends.

-- #X_0# --
One of the principal devils in Hell. #X_0# argues against further war with Heaven, but he does so because he is an embodiment of sloth and inactivity, not for any good reason. His eloquence and learning is great, and he is able to persuade many of the devils with his faulty reasoning.

-- #X_0# --
A devil known in the Bible as the epitome of wealth. #X_0# always walks hunched over, as if he is searching the ground for valuables.

-- #X_0# --
The devil who builds Pandemonium, #X_2#’s palace in Hell. #X_0#’s character is based on a Greek mythological figure known for being a poor architect, but in #X_1#’s poem he is one of the most productive and skilled devils in Hell.

She guards the gates of Hell.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s son by his daughter, #X_2#. #X_0# in turn rapes his mother, begetting the mass of beasts that torment her lower half. The relations between #X_0#, #X_2#, and #X_1# mimic horribly those of the Holy Trinity.

After #X_0# finds a great pearl, he becomes increasingly ambitious and desperate in his mission to break free of the oppression of his colonial society.

A strange outsider, #X_0# rejects the company of his wife, #X_1#, and other adults at the #Y_0# resort where he and #X_1# are on vacation. He prefers to play with children at the resort and on the beach. He has an easy rapport with children and fully immerses himself in a childlike world of imagination when he is with them. When a child named #X_2# claims she sees a bananafish, a creature that #X_0# has invented, he kisses her foot. #X_0# ultimately kills himself in the hotel.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s pretty, socialite wife. #X_0# is unconcerned with #X_1#’s mental condition, although whether she is unconcerned because of indifference or deep love for him is never fully clear. Enamored with beauty and materialistic society, #X_0# is firmly rooted in the materialistic world that #X_1# rejects as well as in the adult world of womanhood and sexuality. In rejecting #X_0#, #X_1# rejects both society and adulthood.

-- #X_0# --
A young child vacationing with her mother. #X_0# befriends #X_1# on the beach and is able to understand him better than any other character, perhaps because her innocence has been untainted—unlike #X_1#, she has not seen the ugliness of the world. However, #X_0# is unnerved by #X_1# when he kisses her foot in the ocean. Although #X_0# is part of the childhood innocence #X_1# would like to repossess, the kiss is an inappropriate gesture. #X_1# has crossed a line, and #X_0# runs away from him when they return to shore.

-- #X_0# --
A nosey socialite who is frantically concerned with #X_0# safety around the erratic #X_2#. #X_0# mother reveals some of #X_2#’s past transgressions, including strange, dangerous behavior and rude comments to family members, all of which suggest the extent of #X_2#’s psychological distress.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# plays a narrator for this play, coming on before and between scenes to retell the action of previous scenes, and to instigate "dumb shows," where some action of the play is pantomimed to advance the action of the play. He also gives the epilogue at the end of the play, pulling together the threads. #X_0# is also the name of a fourteenth-century English poet, whose story of Apollonius of Tyre in the eighth book of his Confessio Amantis served as an important source for this play.

-- #X_0# --
King of Antioch. After his wife's death, he enters into an incestuous relationship with his daughter. When young princes come calling to ask to marry her, he tests them by asking them to answer a riddle correctly, or lose their life.

-- #X_0# --
Husband of Thaisa and father of #X_1#. #X_0#begins the play in Antioch, where he desires to marry Antiochus's daughter. After he discovers their secret, he flees to Tyre. Prone to melancholy, #X_0#worries about Antiochus trying to have him killed, and sets off on more adventures and endures several shipwrecks. In many ways #X_0#is a kind of classical hero figure--always ready to enter a contest or competition, especially if the prize is a king's daughter. While he starts out the play by making active decisions, to go to Antioch and then to flee it, he becomes increasingly inactive throughout the play. Things happen to him, and he endures it, never cursing the gods or his fate. As he must endure greater and greater misfortune, he becomes less active, finally ceasing to speak altogether. Yet #X_0#is above all a good man, and, despite his hardships, has remained virtuous. Hence he is rewarded in the end.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#'s advisors in Tyre, #X_0# takes care of #X_1# in his melancholy moods, and recommends he leave Tyre for a while after the events in Antioch. #X_0# takes over as provisionary ruler of Tyre; when #X_1# fails to return, the citizens want to crown #X_0# king. But #X_0# is loyal to #X_1#, so he refuses. #X_0# is a genuinely good man, not touched by ambition, who believes that #X_1# is the only true ruler of Tyre.

Another of Pericles's advisors, with a lesser role than Helicanus.

#X_0#is the narrator of The Plague. He is one of the first people in #Y_0# to urge that stringent sanitation measures be taken to fight the rising epidemic. A staunch humanist and atheist, #X_0# #X_0# has little patience with the authorities' foot-dragging in response to his call for action. His actions and personality imply that he believes in a personal as well as a social code of ethics. When #Y_0# is placed under quarantine, #X_0# #X_0# continues to doggedly battle the plague despite the signs that his efforts make little or no difference. Although he is separated from his wife, he does not allow his personal distress to distract him from his battle to relieve the collective social suffering wrought on the confused and terrified population of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the author of the account that Dr. #X_1# uses to give greater texture to his chronicle of the plague. #X_0# is vacationing in #Y_0# when the epidemic requires a total quarantine of the city. As an outsider, his observations on #Y_0# society are more objective than those of a citizen of the city. #X_0#'s beliefs about personal and social responsibility are remarkably similar to those of Dr. #X_1#, but #X_0# is far more philosophical. He does not believe in God, so he does not believe in the illusion of an intrinsic rational and moral meaning in death, suffering, and human existence. For him, human existence gains meaning only when people choose freely to participate in the losing, but noble struggle against death and suffering. #X_0# contributes to the anti-plague effort in accordance with his code of ethics.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is an elderly civil servant in #Y_0#. When he accepted his job as a young man, he was promised the opportunity for promotion, but, over the years, he never actively pursued it.

Over the years, #X_0# has tried to write her a letter, but he suffers from an intense anxiety over finding the "right words" to express himself.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is suspicious, paranoid, and mercurial. In the past, he committed a crime that he does not name, so he constantly fears arrest and punishment. When #X_1# falls under total quarantine, #X_0# is happy because he no longer feels alone in his state of constant fear. Moreover, the plague occupies the authorities entirely, so he does not fear arrest. He engages in the profitable smuggling trade during the epidemic and eschews all responsibility to help fight the disease.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a Jesuit priest in #Y_0#. Early during the epidemic, he delivers a sermon to his confused, frightened congregation declaring that the plague is a God-sent punishment for their sins. As the plague rages on, he modifies this stance, seeing the Plague as a supreme test of faith.

Dr. #X_1#'s #X_0# #X_0# serves as mouthpiece for the changing whims of Oran society during the prolonged epidemic.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the chairman of the medical association in #Y_0#. When #X_2# and #X_1# suggest that the strange illness is the bubonic plague, #X_0# does not want to believe it. He prefers to adopt a "wait-and-see" attitude instead of "alarming the public" with immediate, decisive action.

-- #X_0# --

Once a carefree, nature-loving, beautiful girl, #X_0# has been beaten down by her husband's dour and fanatical views. Though she fears for her children's safety, she is kept passive by a combination of fear, loyalty, and the belief that God really is on her husband's side. As the danger to her children becomes more tangible, however, #X_0# slowly begins to regain her ability to act out on her own. Unfortunately, it takes the death of her youngest daughter to finally force her to regain full control of her own and her daughter's fates.

-- #X_0# --
At the start of the book, #X_0# is a materialistic, egotistical, and stupid girl of fifteen. As we watch her age to fifty, little changes in her personality. Her appearance remains her chief concern, and her own well being the only force that can motivate her. With her good looks, she catches a string of wealthy husbands, one of whom leaves her a luxury hotel deep in the heart of the French #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
We first see #X_0# as an idealistic fourteen-year-old tomboy, who worships her father and believes fully in his God. As she confronts the political and daily realities in the #Y_0#, however, she loses her religious faith, and begins to despise her father. She does not, however, lose her idealism.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s twin sister #X_0# is born with a condition called "hemiplegia," which prevents her from using the left side of her body. Rather than view herself with pity, #X_0# places herself in voluntary exile from the world, looking on as a wry and brilliant observer, rather than an active participant.

The previous missionary in #Y_1#, but was removed from the post due to inappropriate fraternizing with the natives. Indeed, as it turns out when the #X_1#s finally meet him, he married a native woman. #X_0# has a deep understanding of and sympathy for the Congolese people and their religion, and provides an attractive contrast to the blind and base #Y_0# of Reverend #X_1#.

A parrot, left for the #X_3#s by Brother #X_1#. Early on in their stay, #X_2# flings #X_0# from his cage, giving him freedom. #X_0#, however, does not know what to do with his independence.

Unusually bright, #X_0# picks up English quickly and helps the girls learn the native language and customs.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is the village chief. He is wary of Reverend #X_2# and his proselytizing, afraid that a move toward Christianity will effect a moral decline in his village. He does not want the people to neglect their traditional gods. He tries in many subtle and tactful ways to inform the #X_2#s that their presence is not welcome, but #X_1# obtusely ignores these signals.

-- #X_0# --
The much-revered keeper of the old traditions, the religious leader of the village. Like #X_1# he is unhappy about Reverend #X_3#'s presence, and concerned that the traditions of the village be upheld. Unlike #X_1#, however, he does not take a subtle and diplomatic route to ridding himself of the #X_3#s. Instead, he begins to plant poisonous mamba snakes next to the beds of those connected to the #X_3# family. One of these snakes, intended for #X_2#, ends up killing #X_5#.

-- #X_0# --

The novel's protagonist, the Lady of the title. #X_0# is a young woman from #Y_0#, #Y_1#, who travels to Europe with her aunt, Mrs. #X_3#. #X_0#'s experiences in Europe—she is wooed by an English lord, inherits a fortune, and falls prey to a villainous scheme to marry her to the sinister #X_1#—force her to confront the conflict between her desire for personal independence and her commitment to social propriety. #X_0# is the main focus of Portrait of a Lady, and most of the thematic exploration of the novel occurs through her actions, thoughts, and experiences. Ultimately, #X_0# chooses to remain in her miserable marriage to #X_2# rather than to violate custom by leaving him and searching for a happier life.

-- #X_0# --
A cruel, narcissistic gentleman of no particular social standing or wealth, who seduces #X_1# and marries her for her money. An art collector, #X_0# poses as a disinterested aesthete, but in reality he is desperate for the recognition and admiration of those around him. He treats everyone who loves him as simply an object to be used to fulfill his desires; he bases his daughter #X_3#'s upbringing on the idea that she should be unswervingly subservient to him, and he even treats his longtime lover Madame #X_2# as a mere tool. #X_1#'s marriage to #X_0# forces her to confront the conflict between her desire for independence and the painful social proprieties that force her to remain in her marriage.

-- #X_0# --

It is #X_0# who convinces Mr. #X_0# to leave #X_1# her fortune, and it is #X_0# who is the staunchest advocate of #X_1# remaining independent. #X_0# serves as the moral center of Portrait of a Lady: his opinions about other characters are always accurate, and he serves as a kind of moral barometer for the reader, who can tell immediately whether a character is good or evil by #X_0#'s response to that character.

-- #X_0# --
An aristocratic neighbor of the #X_4# who falls in love with #X_2# during her first visit to #X_1#. #X_0# remains in love with #X_2# even after she rejects his proposal and later tries to marry #X_3# simply to bring himself closer to #X_2#'s life.

At the end of the book, #X_0# disappoints #X_4# by giving up her independence in order to marry Mr. #X_1#.

When #X_2# becomes #X_0#'s stepmother, she learns to love the girl; #X_0# is a large part of the reason why #X_2# chooses to return to #Y_1# at the end of the novel, when she could escape her miserable marriage by remaining in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s vapid sister, who covers up her own marital infidelities by gossipping constantly about the affairs of other married women. The #X_0# seems to have a good heart, however, opposing #X_2#'s scheme to marry #X_3# and #X_1# and eventually revealing to #X_1# the truth of #X_2#'s relationship to #X_3# and #X_4#'s parentage.

-- #X_0# --
Unnamed for the entirety of the novel, the priest or "the whiskey priest" as he sometimes refers to himself, is the protagonist and the character upon whom the novel's most important moral questions center. He spends the majority of the novel on the run from the police, friendless and homeless and searching for some sense of purpose in his life. His decadent, indulgent life as a parish priest takes place before the novel begins, but it is present in his thoughts throughout the novel as a source of deep humiliation. He spends the novel pursued by the police who believe the #Y_0# exploits the poor, and tormented by his own sense of guilt. He meets his daughter, the product of a secret affair with one of his parishioners, and finds that his love for her makes it impossible for him to repent the sin of conceiving her. He often chastises himself for impulses and reactions that are very normal and very human.

-- #X_0# --
A believer in the law, a staunch opponent of the Catholic #Y_0#, and the priest's pursuer. #X_0# lieutenant's hatred of the #Y_0# stems from a traumatic event in his childhood, and it is a memory he wishes to eradicate along with all vestiges of religion. He lives a modest, almost monastic life, uninterested in any kind of sensual pleasure and desiring only the attainment of his goals. His "dapper", well-kept appearance stands in striking contrast to the confusion and grime that surround him. #X_0# ruthless tactics he employs in his pursuit of the priest seem to contradict his left-wing political and social ideals. But his conversations with the priest and a few of his more generous gestures at the novel's close indicate that he is a conflicted person, capable of empathy and perhaps even change.

-- #X_0# --
A person the priest meets about halfway through his journey and who continues to reappear throughout the last half of the novel. #X_0# mestizo is from the very beginning an untrustworthy character who seems intent on betraying the priest. Impoverished, occasionally delirious and always calculating, the mestizo sees in the outlawed priest an opportunity to make money. His yellow eyes and fangs are noteworthy physical features that suggest menace and evil. Like #X_2# in the story of #X_1#, the mestizo becomes an unwitting participant, even catalyst, in a story about one man's path to glory.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a young American girl whom the priest meets early on in the novel when she discovers him hiding on her family's property. Independent-minded and responsible, she anchors her family emotionally and takes charge of the business when her hapless father neglects it. Although a self-professed atheist since the age of ten, #X_0# is deeply affected by her brief encounter with the priest, and she, in turn, remains a presence in the priest's mind during his journeys.

-- #X_0# --
A youngster growing up in this violent and impoverished land. #X_0#listens with skepticism to stories about #X_1#, a martyred #X_0#.

He represents the human ability to better itself by teaching its youth.

-- #X_0# --
The priest's illegitimate daughter. #X_0# meets with her father briefly during his stay at her village.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s mother and the woman with whom the priest had a brief but extremely significant affair. #X_0# is unhappy to see the priest return, although she helps him to escape capture when the police come to her village.

-- #X_0# --
The only other priest in the novel besides the protagonist. #X_0# opted to renounce his faith rather than flee the state or face execution. Forced to marry, #X_0# is allowed to remain in his town as a symbol of the weakness of the priesthood. He is mocked regularly by the children in his neighborhood and feels a deep and abiding sense of shame over the choices he has made.

-- #X_0# --
An Englishman living in #Y_0# and working as a dentist. #X_0# is living a life of apathy and vacancy. A portrait of spiritual deadness, estranged from his wife and filled with a low-level loathing of #Y_0#, #X_0# is the first character the reader encounters.

An American outlaw, and the other "hunted man" in this novel. #X_0# gringo is wanted for murder. Although his reputation seems to fill people with a strange admiration, when we finally encounter him near the novel's end, he turns out to be little more than a common criminal.

#X_1#'s father. #X_0#is a benign, if ineffectual, plantation owner, who tries to remain cheerful and optimistic in the face of difficult times and an isolated existence.

-- #X_0# --
A person the priest meets during his night in jail. #X_0#is too proud of herself and her convictions to be truly #X_0#. She looks down on the priest for having sympathy for the other prisoners in the cell.

-- #X_0# --

An extremely precocious student and a naturally brilliant boxer, #X_0#is loved by almost all who meet him. He moves a legend amongst black #Y_0#ns, who believe that he has come to avenge them against the Afrikaners. Each side, however, wishes to claim #X_0#for themselves. #X_0#'s generosity and altruism leads him to devise ways of helping black prisoners write and receive letters, and to teach black men to box. #X_0#'s sense of humor, his fascinating philosophical and analytical voice, and his ability to criticize himself allow us to identify closely with him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is a German music professor, in his 80s, with whom #X_3# becomes best friends in the town of #Y_0#. #X_0#'s loves are music, cacti, whisky, and coffee. #X_0#was a concert pianist in #Y_2# before he gave up performing after a disastrous concert in #Y_1# in 1925. He is one of #X_3#'s most important mentors, but is prized by the #Y_0# citizens only for the culture he brings to the town through his classical music. The only characters other than #X_3# with whom #X_0#has much contact are #X_2# and Mrs. #X_1#. When #X_0#dies, he leaves all his belongings to #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --

A rascal of a man, he nevertheless becomes #X_3#'s personal boxing trainer in #Y_0# and develops a close relationship with both #X_3# and #X_2#. #X_0# is largely responsible for spreading the myth of the Tadpole Angel. The most important lesson he teaches #X_3# in terms of boxing is to fight with his feet- he tells #X_3# to "dance" with his feet. #X_0# is brutally murdered by one of the #Y_0# prison warders, #X_1#, who grows suspicious of #X_3# and #X_0#'s close relationship. Together #X_3# and #X_0# were running a black market within the prison.

-- #X_0# --

The son of Tabby #X_0# and Rev. #X_1# (though he does not know who his father is until the end of the novel), #X_0# is raised by the aristocratic #X_0# family in #Y_0#, #Y_1#. As a young man he is led to religious faith by the life of his best friend #X_2# Meany, and in 1987, he decides to write down #X_2#'s story and to chronicle the awakening of his own belief in God. Though he has an active religious life, #X_0# is also extremely bitter and furiously angry about his experience, and frequently launches into lengthy diatribes against the #X_5# administration. As a middle-aged man, he remains a virgin, "neutered," he says, by the things that have happened to him. In the novel, #X_0# serves both as a fixed perspective and as a contrast to the character of #X_2# Meany, a passive foil for #X_2#'s charismatic dynamism.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s best friend, a dwarf with weirdly luminous skin and a high-pitched, nasal voice represented in the novel in all capital letters. #X_0#'s father runs a granite quarry; some of #X_0#'s eccentricities may be due to the inhalation of granite dust at an early age. Despite his tiny size, #X_0# is a powerful personality, often dominating situations and telling adults what to do even when he is a young child. #X_0# possesses a powerful and personal religious faith, believing himself to be God's instrument on Earth; he also believes that everything that happens is fated, and that his own dreams are prophecies of his future purpose in life. (As it turns out at the end of the novel, he is right.) When #X_0# and #X_1# are eleven, #X_0# accidentally kills #X_1#'s mother when a foul ball he hits at a #Y_0# game breaks her neck.

By 1987, #X_0# has become a rock star, performing under the name "#X_0# the Molester." During their adolescence, #X_0# becomes romantically and possibly sexually involved with #X_5# Meany, and develops a passionate, fatalistic attachment to him. In the novel, #X_0# gives #X_3# an instrument for introducing the murky element of sexuality and gender relations into the lives of his boy-heroes. Like #X_4#, she remains deeply damaged by #X_5#'s death for the rest of her life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s mother, who keeps the identity of #X_1#'s father a secret from him. Killed by a foul ball hit by #X_2# Meany in a 1953 #Y_0# game, Tabby #X_0# represents a kind of idealized vision of both motherhood and womanhood--as #X_2#, who has a terrible crush on her, says, she has "THE BEST BREASTS OF ALL THE MOTHERS."

-- #X_0# --

Her realization of #X_2#’s essential goodness eventually triumphs over her initial prejudice against him.

-- #X_0# --
A wealthy gentleman, the master of #Y_0#, and the nephew of Lady #X_1#. Though #X_0# is intelligent and honest, his excess of pride causes him to look down on his social inferiors.

-- #X_0# --
The eldest and most beautiful #X_0# sister. #X_0# is more reserved and gentler than #X_4#. The easy pleasantness with which she and #X_2# interact contrasts starkly with the mutual distaste that marks the encounters between #X_4# and #X_3#.

A pompous, generally idiotic clergyman who stands to inherit #X_0# #X_2#’s property. #X_0#’s own social status is nothing to brag about, but he takes great pains to let everyone and anyone know that Lady #X_3# serves as his patroness. He is the worst combination of snobbish and obsequious.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s snobbish sister. #X_0# bears inordinate disdain for #X_2#’s middle-class background. Her vain attempts to garner #X_1#’s attention cause #X_1# to admire #X_2#’s self-possessed character even more.

-- #X_0# --
A rich, bossy noblewoman; Mr. #X_1#’s patron and #X_2#’s aunt. #X_0# #X_0# epitomizes class snobbery, especially in her attempts to or#X_0#r the middle-class #X_3# away from her well-bred nephew.

#X_0# #X_1#’s brother and his wife. The #X_0#s, caring, nurturing, and full of common sense, often prove to be better parents to the #X_1# daughters than #X_0# #X_1# and his wife.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s dear friend. Pragmatic where #X_2# is romantic, and also six years older than #X_2#, #X_0# does not view love as the most vital component of a marriage. She is more interested in having a comfortable home. Thus, when Mr. #X_1# proposes, she accepts.

The ability to conquer and govern. #X_1# uses this term as the opposite of “fortune.”

The #X_0# of Florin, and #X_2#'s father. #X_0#, by the time of the story, is quite old, deaf, and difficult to understand.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# of Florin and #X_1#'s stepmother.

-- #X_0# --
Once the king's leading miracle man, but #X_1# fired him and so he retired. However, #X_0# still knows enough magic to resurrect #X_2# from the dead.

-- #X_0# --
Miracle Max's wife. #X_0#s stands in as his witch, since all miracle men must have their own witches.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# strange and silent character who takes care of #X_1#'s Zoo of Death.

-- #X_0# --
The most feared pirate name on the seas. #X_0# captured #X_2#, and passed the name onto him.

-- #X_0# --
The Chief of all Enforcement in #Y_0#. Along with Count #X_3#, #X_0# is #X_2#'s only confidante.

-- #X_0# --
Inigo #X_0#'s father. #X_0# was a great sword-maker who was killed by Count #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#Y_0#'s most famous sword-maker, for whom #X_1#'s father made back-order swords.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the play. #X_0# aided #X_3# against his fellow Titans only to be punished for giving fire to human beings. #X_0# demonstrates the value of thought and knowledge in progress as well as in the opposition and temperance of tyrannical power. He is a rare example of a Greek tragic hero whose faults, such as excessive pride and stubbornness, ennoble him. #X_0# opposes #X_3# because of his anger over his punishment, bolstered by his anger over the mistreatment of his brothers and #X_2#. He is also driven to opposition by a belief in the value friendship. His friendship for humanity is the cause of his punishment, but he views as equally important #X_3#'s inability to recognize the importance of friendship. #X_0# shows that if intellect and force cannot work together, then intellect must oppose force, since it is useless if dominated by power.

-- #X_0# --
Though he does not appear in the play, #X_0# clearly deserves mention as a major character. He rules by his own laws, creating a world where no one but him can be free. Both the objects of his hatred and his love can easily fall to misfortune since #X_0#, unfamiliar with sympathy and pity, does not concern himself with the welfare of others. Unable to rule through any means other than brute force, #X_0# is presented as a perfect example of a fairly stupid but powerful tyrant who shows no regard for others not because he is evil but because he hasn't given it any thought. #X_0#'s servants take it for granted that everyone must be taught to love him and hate his enemies. #X_0#'s rule demands that his servants surrender any trace of individuality in obedience to his will.

-- #X_0# --
A mindless servant of #X_2#. #X_0# appears in sharp contrast to #X_1#. Like his master, #X_0# understands neither friendship nor pity, but only force and obedience. #X_0# is certain that he is on the right side, and certain also that his master is all-powerful. Though he comes down from Olympus to question #X_1# about the future threat to #X_2#'s power, #X_0# clearly does not take this threat seriously. He is highly arrogant, but not horribly bright as illustrated in a scene where every insult and accusations he throws at #X_1# gets turned around by the recipient and shipped back in force.

-- #X_0# --
A victim of #X_2#'s love. #X_0# is exiled from her home because #X_2# wishes to deflower her. Transformed into a cow, she wanders the earth awaiting salvation. #X_0# is seen as a parallel to #X_1#: though she suffers, in the end she will be freed and rewarded. Her descendant will free #X_1#, bonding their fates together. As the only human, despite being technically bovine, in the play, #X_0# ties the cosmic conflict of gods to known human history and geography as #X_1# documents her wanderings and the future of her offspring.

-- #X_0# --
Serve the proper role of a Chorus in Greek tragedy. The #X_0# advocate adherence to the moral norm to a protagonist who has deviated from that norm. Until the end, the #X_0# maintain two moral orientations. First, they consistently demonstrate sympathy with the hero's suffering and avow their friendship. Second, they counsel him to bow down to a greater power and tone down his defiance since nothing good can come of opposing #X_1#. By deviating from the moral norm at the end, however, the #X_0# manage to establish a new moral norm that contradicts #X_1#'s own laws.

-- #X_0# --
Comfortable in his service to #X_2#, #X_0# believes that one should not rock the boat but simply obey. He agrees that #X_2# is too harsh and extends his sympathy to #X_1# with an offer of help. Something about #X_0#'s advice and his demeanor seems a little off-putting, however. First, he suggests that one should simply give up and accept injustice rather than fighting it—#X_1# should stop being defiant and not provoke a stubborn and excessive #X_2#. Second, #X_1# clearly does not trust #X_0#, telling him much less than he had told the Chorus only a moment ago. #X_0#, while counseling his friend and expressing sympathy, seems to be waiting to leave the entire time—he does not get off his winged animal and states that it is eager to fly home, as if his visit to #X_1# was only a chore on a long list.

-- #X_0# --
Like Oceanus, #X_0# is an obedient but unwilling servant. He bows to Zeus's force, but wishes he did not have to. #X_0# first introduces pity and friendship into the tragedy while chiding Zeus's servants for their insensitivity. Yet #X_0# does what he is told, showing him to be closer to Kratus than to Prometheus in his outlook. #X_0#, however, seems to obey more out of fear than out of a complete identification with his ruler, which seems more the case with Kratus and Hermes.

-- #X_0# --
Simply accepts #X_1#'s orders completely. #X_1#'s justice, for #X_0#, is the only possible justice. #X_0# cannot understand how someone might fail to hate an enemy of #X_1#. He shows an absolute identification of a slave with his master, taking #X_1#'s thoughts as his thoughts and #X_1#'s orders as his maxims. Unlike Hephaestus and Oceanus, #X_0# experiences no friendship or pity because he has no value system outside the one imposed on him by #X_1#. The name #X_0# means force, so as a representative of #X_1#, this character demonstrates the nature of #X_1#'s rule.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#'s name means violence, representing the nature of #X_3#'s power. #X_0# is a silent character, helping #X_1# bring #X_2# to the rock to be chained. We can assume that what holds for #X_1# holds also for #X_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The town eccentric, #X_0# #X_0# first came to Dawson's Landing intending to set up a law practice. His sense of humor proves too much for the townspeople, though, and his law practice goes nowhere. He fills his time with odd surveying and accounting jobs, and dabbles in a number of quasi-scientific hobbies, most notably fingerprinting and palmistry. Judge #X_3# is his closest friend. #X_0# has also written a calendar full of clever sayings and dark proverbs, which provides the epigraphs for each chapter of the text. #X_0# is an outsider, and thinks a little differently from the rest of the townspeople.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, called #X_3#, begins as a slave owned by #X_2#. Only one-sixteenth black, she looks white, and is described as an extremely beautiful woman. She gives birth to a son, #X_1#, who will later be known as "#X_4#" when she switches him with another infant. #X_3# is tough, intelligent, and resourceful, and, although she is freed when #X_2# dies, she is the character most threatened by slavery.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s son. At a young age he is switched by his mother with Thomas a Becket #X_2#, a white child who shares his birthday and looks just like him. From then on he is known as "#X_5#." Raised as a white heir to a substantial estate, "#X_5#" is spoiled, vicious, and dissolute. His penchant for gambling leads him into #X_0#bt, and his "uncle," Judge #X_2#, frequently disinherits him, only to rewrite his will again.

-- #X_0# --
The son of #X_3# #X_0#, #X_6# is switched with #X_5#'s baby #X_2# when he is only a few months old, and is called "#X_2#" from then on. "#X_2#" is raised as a slave and is purchased by Judge #X_0# when #X_3# dies to prevent "#X_6#" from selling him "down the river." "#X_2#" is a decent young man who is often forced to fight bullies for "#X_6#." He speaks in a black dialect.

-- #X_0# --
A member of a prominent #Y_1# family, the judge is a leading citizen of #Y_0#. He and his wife are childless, but adopt "#X_3#" when the judge's brother, Percy #X_0#, dies. The judge is powerful enough to indulge his eccentricities, and he forms a philosophical society with #X_2# after he retires from the bench. The judge is wealthy and generally kind-hearted, and supports "#X_3#," even paying his gambling debts.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#Capello, a set of near-identical twins, appear in #Y_0# in reply to an ad placed by Aunt #X_2#, who is looking for a boarder. They say they are looking to relax after years of traveling the world. They claim to be the children of an Italian nobleman who was forced to flee #Y_1# after a revolution and died soon afterward. According to their story, they were enslaved by a traveling circus and put on display (in the first version of #X_4#'s story they were Siamese twins). After several years they escaped and went into business for themselves, putting themselves on display. The twins are good-looking and smooth-talking, and the townspeople fall over themselves trying to be associated with them. #X_0# has a dark secret in his past, though: he once killed a man who tried to rob them and was about to kill #X_0#. #X_0#'s temper gets him into trouble in #Y_0#, too: he assaults "#X_3#" after "#X_3#" insults him. This leads to a duel in which the twins, with their old-world traditions, are only too happy to take part. While they seem suspicious, the twins are never unmasked as conmen; instead, they leave #Y_0# vindicated and triumphant.

-- #X_0# --
Judge #X_0#'s brother and #X_2#'s father. A speculator, he dies when #X_2# and "#X_2#" are fifteen, with his estate heavily encumbered by debt. Shortly before he dies, he frees #X_1#, who was his slave.

-- #X_0# --
A lawyer, a close friend of Judge #X_1#, and another descendant of what #X_2# calls the "FFV's"- -the First Families of #Y_0#. #X_0# supports the judge in his ideas about #Y_0#n honor. He is the one who prosecutes the twins for the judge's murder.

-- #X_0# --
Judge #X_1#'s widowed sister and "#X_3#"'s surrogate mother. She helps to keep "#X_3#" in the judge's good graces.

-- #X_0# --
Yet another Virginian and friend of Judge #X_3#'s. He dies the same year as Percy #X_3#. #X_5# reveals that he is the father of her son (#X_2#). Her revelation explains the rather awkward introduction and dismissal of #X_0# #X_0# in the first chapter.

-- #X_0# --
The widow, known to the town as Aunt #X_1#, takes the twins in as boarders. She and her daughter #X_2# fan the flames of the twins' celebrity for their own benefit. Everyone is at her house when the string of robberies takes place.

-- #X_0# --
Aunt #X_2#'s daughter and the town belle. She epitomizes the townspeople's intense response to the twins. The narrator hints that she may have been involved with "#X_3#" romantically.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0# is a professor of phonetics who plays Pygmalion to #X_1# Galatea. He is the author of #X_0#' Universal Alphabet, believes in concepts like visible speech, and uses all manner of recording and photographic material to document his phonetic subjects, reducing people and their dialects into what he sees as readily understandable units. He is an unconventional man, who goes in the opposite direction from the rest of society in most matters. Indeed, he is impatient with high society, forgetful in his public graces, and poorly considerate of normal social niceties--the only reason the world has not turned against him is because he is at heart a good and harmless man. His biggest fault is that he can be a bully.

-- #X_0# --
"She is not at all a romantic figure." So is she introduced in Act I. Everything about #X_0#seems to defy any conventional notions we might have about the romantic heroine. When she is transformed from a sassy, smart-mouthed kerbstone flower girl with deplorable English, to a (still sassy) regal figure fit to consort with nobility, it has less to do with her innate qualities as a heroine than with the fairy-tale aspect of the transformation myth itself. In other words, the character of #X_0#comes across as being much more instrumental than fundamental. The real (re-)making of #X_0#happens after the ambassador's party, when she decides to make a statement for her own dignity against #X_2#' insensitive treatment. This is when she becomes, not a duchess, but an independent woman; and this explains why #X_2# begins to see #X_0# not as a mill around his neck but as a creature worthy of his admiration.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0#, the author of Spoken Sanskrit, is a match for #X_3# (although somewhat less obsessive) in his passion for phonetics. But where #X_3# is a boorish, careless bully, #X_0# is always considerate and a genuinely gentleman. He says little of note in the play, and appears most of all to be a civilized foil to #X_3#' barefoot, absentminded crazy professor. He helps in the #X_1# Doolittle experiment by making a wager of it, saying he will cover the costs of the experiment if #X_3# does indeed make a convincing duchess of her. However, while #X_3# only manages to teach #X_1# pronunciations, it is #X_0#'s thoughtful treatment towards #X_1# that teaches her to respect herself.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_1#'s father, an elderly but vigorous dustman who has had at least six wives and who "seems equally free from fear and conscience." When he learns that his daughter has entered the home of #X_2#, he immediately pursues to see if he can get some money out of the circumstance. His unique brand of rhetoric, an unembarrassed, unhypocritical advocation of drink and pleasure (at other people's expense), is amusing to #X_3#. Through #X_3#' joking recommendation, #X_0# becomes a richly endowed lecturer to a moral reform society, transforming him from lowly dustman to a picture of middle class morality--he becomes miserable. Throughout, #X_0# is a scoundrel who is willing to sell his daughter to make a few pounds, but he is one of the few unaffected characters in the play, unmasked by appearance or language. Though scandalous, his speeches are honest. At points, it even seems that he might be #X_4#'s voice piece of social criticism (#X_0#'s proletariat status, given #X_4#'s socialist leanings, makes the prospect all the more likely).

-- #X_0# --
Professor #X_0#' mother, #X_0# is a stately lady in her sixties who sees the #X_2# experiment as idiocy, and #X_0# and #X_3# as senseless children. She is the first and only character to have any qualms about the whole affair. When her worries prove true, it is to her that all the characters turn. Because no woman can match up to his mother, #X_0# claims, he has no interest in dallying with them. To observe the mother of #X_4# (#X_0#), who completely understands all of his failings and inadequacies, is a good contrast to the mythic proportions to which #X_0# builds himself in his self-estimations as a scientist of phonetics and a creator of duchesses.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#' surmise that #X_0# is a fool is probably accurate. In the opening scene he is a spineless and resourceless lackey to his mother and sister. Later, he is comically bowled over by #X_1#, the half-baked duchess who still speaks cockney. He becomes lovesick for #X_1#, and courts her with letters. At the play's close, #X_0# serves as a young, viable marriage option for #X_1#, making the possible path she will follow unclear to the reader.

-- #X_0# --
A middle-aged British journalist. #X_0# is both the narrator and the principal character of the novel  a Vietnamese mistress named #X_1#. As a reporter, he feels particularly concerned with maintaining a level of disinterest that is appropriate for his profession. He is a psychologically complicated character whose choices are frequently motivated by a fear of loneliness and death. #X_0# prefers the concrete facts of reality to the more abstract thinking of political theorists. He disapproves strongly of American politics and society.

-- #X_0# --
A young American intelligence operative working undercover in #Y_3# in #Y_1#. #X_0# is the “quiet American” of the novel’s title, a soft-spoken idealist who is motivated to facilitate political change in #Y_2#. He comes from a privileged East Coast family and was educated at #Y_0#, where he studied the political theory of #X_4#. The naïveté of #X_0#’s social and political beliefs causes tensions with #X_1#. #X_0#’s coveting of #X_2# intensifies these tensions, as does his covert involvement with the militant nationalist General #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s beautiful young Vietnamese lover. #X_0# stays with #X_1# because he offers her security and protection. When she turns her affection to #X_3#, it is because she believes that he can provide longer-term security through marriage. #X_0# is a somewhat vain woman who enjoys shopping for scarves and poring over books about English royalty. She is easily influenced by her sister, Miss #X_2#. #X_0#’s name means “Phoenix,” a mythical bird that is cyclically reborn by bursting into flames and then rising from the ashes.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s mistreated young wife, who produces his two male heirs. #X_0# is treated pitifully, as little more than a slave, and her sons do not respect her any more than #X_2# does. #X_0#’s character is not found in the Bible—she is purely #X_1#’s invention.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_4#’s granddaughters. #X_3# becomes close to #X_0# when she moves to the Valley of the Kings and marries #X_2#.

Though he is dedicated to doing his duty by healing the men so that they may return to fight, #X_0# feels conflicted about the amount of control and influence he has over his patients.

-- #X_0# --
In real life, a distinguished soldier and Great War poet. In the novel, #X_0# is both of these things as well. He is depicted as being truthful, self- composed, morally upright, and slightly arrogant. Though he strongly opposes the war, #X_0# has not had a breakdown, and he feels uncomfortable around the other patients in the hospital. He looks to #X_1# as a father figure. In the end, #X_0# returns to his duty, though he maintains his belief that the war is wrong.

-- #X_0# --
An initially difficult patient with a bad attitude who suffers from mutism and severe asthma. #X_0# is a complicated character; though he gives the staff a hard time he truly wants to get better. He challenges #X_1# to apply some analysis to himself by turning the doctor's questions back around on him. As a young man from the working class who has risen to the rank of officer, #X_0# tackles with issues of social class.

-- #X_0# --
A patient at #Y_0# who has been unable to eat since a bomb threw him into the body of a gas-filled German cadaver. The emaciated #X_0# refrains from talking about his problems.

-- #X_0# --
The girlfriend of #X_1#. #X_0# is a young, working-class woman who works in a munitions factory in #Y_0#. Like her mother, she is very practical. She is not sure that true love between a man and a woman is possible, but she is willing to give it a try. As a woman, #X_0# has been shielded from many of the horrors of the war. Nevertheless, she is angered that a society that sends its sons out to be killed refuses to face the consequences of the war.

-- #X_0# --
The mother of #X_1# #X_0#. #X_0# is a practical woman who does not believe in love between a man and a woman. She desires nothing more than for her daughters to be the beneficiaries of a stable pension from their deceased husbands. #X_0# is very involved in her daughter's life, and she cautions #X_1# about the risks of pregnancy. #X_0# is toughened by the reality of raising two daughters alone in a time when women do not make much money.

-- #X_0# --
Dr. #X_2#'s patient at #Y_1# in #Y_0#, and one of his more interesting cases. After serving in almost every major battle of the First World War, #X_0# finds himself in the hospital suffering from mutism. He appears insolent in his illness, merely smiling at the doctor who offers to cure him. #X_0# initially fights back against the treatment, but eventually resigns himself to it. #X_1# notes that #X_0# appears broken.

-- #X_0# --
A fellow poet and soldier and a good friend of #X_1#. Although #X_0# agrees with #X_1# that the war is evil and unjust, he refuses to protest. #X_0# feels that regardless of his personal beliefs, it is his duty to honor his contract to his country. #X_1# thinks #X_0# is hypocritical for this stance. Nevertheless, #X_0# is a true friend to #X_1#; he always tries to do what is best for his friend, even if he does not do what is best for his cause.

-- #X_0# --
A patient who comes to #X_1# relatively late in the novel. Although there is nothing physically wrong with his spine, #X_0# is paralyzed from the waist down. Yet he refuses to believe there is anything psychologically wrong with him. #X_0# quickly grows frustrated by his feelings of powerlessness, but by the end of the novel he recovers his ability to walk.

-- #X_0# --
An old friend of #X_1# from their days at #Y_0#. Like #X_1#, #X_0# is now a practicing psychiatrist.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# #X_3#'s parents. Mr. and Mrs. #X_3# are extraordinarily different from each other, both in personality and in relation to their son. Mrs. #X_3# is a nervous woman who always protected her son to the point of making him more sensitive than was socially accepted at the time. She wants him to achieve in life and ascend up the social ladder. Mr. #X_3#, in contrast, is a rough, working-class man who believes that his son must grow up the hard way. He believes it is presumptuous and wrong for #X_1# to reach beyond his class and station.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_2#. #X_0# is a fellow worker in the munitions factory in #Y_0#. Her husband abuses her, and she is happy that war has given her the freedom to work and be separated from him while he is off at war. #X_0# is very blunt, using frank language and always telling it like it is.

-- #X_0# --
A world-class butler for many years who comes to work at #Y_0# when he is already in his seventies and struggling with arthritis. Mr. William #X_1# and his son only communicate very formally until the night the elder #X_1# is on his deathbed. #X_0#is extremely dedicated to his work as a butler; #X_1# often holds him up as an example of what a "great butler" should be.

-- #X_0# --
Lord #X_1#'s godson. After Reggie #X_0#'s father passes away, Lord #X_1# treats the young man as his kin, though their political views differ widely. #X_0# is a journalist, and it infuriates him that the Nazis have used Lord #X_1#'s noble instincts to turn him into a pawn for their fascist regime. #X_0# is the one who tells #X_4# directly that the Nazis have been using Lord #X_1#—#X_0# is amazed that #X_4# has not noticed himself. #X_0# is later killed in the war, in #Y_0#.

#X_0# is the Greek term for the state of helplessness—the inability to proceed—that ends all of #X_1#’s early dialogues. Through his pointed questioning, #X_2# succeeds in showing that his interlocutors have no appropriate definition for the topic under consideration (be that topic piety, love, courage, justice, or whatever else), but nor is he able to supply one himself. In Book I of The Republic #X_2# brings his friends to a state of aporia on the topic of justice, but then in the next nine books he manages to move beyond the aporia and give an actual answer to the question at hand.

The brave but unassuming hobbit who bears the Ring back to Mordor. #X_0# has a quiet determination and a strength of character that establish his distinctive heroism. Increasingly affected and burdened by the Ring’s power, #X_0# assumes a more passive role in The Return of the King than in the first two volumes of The Lord of the Rings. Nonetheless, #X_0#’s ultimate struggle to overcome the temptation and burden of the Ring reminds us that an individual with less courage and moral fiber would be unable to complete the quest.

However, even as she hates the heath, #X_0# seems in her deep, brooding passion, to be a part of its wild nature. She has an amorous relationship with #X_2#, but enters into a tragic marriage with #X_1# when she realizes that he is the more interesting, and urbane, of the two men.

-- #X_0# --
A local innkeeper, #X_0# is described as a "lady-killer." At the start of the novel, he puts off his marriage to #X_3# Yeobright in order to pursue a relationship with the woman he truly wants, #X_1# Vye; when he is jilted by #X_1#, however, he marries #X_3#, and has a daughter with her. He drowns at the end of the novel just before making an escape with #X_1#. He is interested throughout in possession rather than love.

-- #X_0# --
Clym #X_0#'s cousin and Mrs. #X_0#'s niece and ward. #X_0# is an innocent and goodhearted, if somewhat vacuous, woman who seems genuinely to care for #X_2#--who, however, is merely using her to make #X_4# Vye jealous. She eventually marries #X_6#--over the objections of her aunt--and has a child, which she names #X_4#. At the end of the novel, she marries #X_3#, who has long loved her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# #X_0#'s mother, and Thomasin #X_0#'s aunt and guardian. A proper, class-conscious, proud woman, #X_0#objects to the marriage of both her charges; as it turns out, she is entirely correct. She dies when, exhausted, she is bitten by an adder on the heath, believing that #X_1# has utterly rejected her. The daughter of a parson, #X_0#considers herself--and is considered--of a higher class than the local laborers.

-- #X_0# --
An awkward, superstitious young man who works for Mrs. #X_3#. #X_0# provides comic relief throughout the novel with his dolorous over-certainty that he will never marry and his petty phobias. He fails in his mission to bring #X_2# her inheritance, thus contributing to the degeneration of the family relationships.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s grandfather and guardian, a former captain in the British navy. A reclusive and silent man.

-- #X_0# --
The son of Susan #X_0#. The boy has the knack of being in the right place at the right time: he reports #X_4# and #X_2#'s tryst to #X_3#, and is also the one who tells #X_1# of his mother's damning last words.

-- #X_0# --
A local youth who works for the #X_2#, and who falls hopelessly in love with Eustacia.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#whose simple dialect and observance of local customs form the cultural backdrop for the novel.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the protagonist of the play, an Everyman slacker who finds neither his work in an office nor the culture around him fulfilling. Alienated, yet still confused as to why he has been displaced, he is unwilling to commit himself to anything in life but his love for #X_1#. His friend #X_2# constantly reprimands the submissive #X_0# for his uncouth appearance and apathetic attitudes.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_1#'s foil, a highly cultured, somewhat arrogant and angry young man who prides himself on his rationality. He urges #X_1# to be more like him. His occasional lapses, however, expose cracks in his façade of efficiency.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# is a highly rational man who appears only in the first act, but who is referred to several other times. He believes strictly in the laws of logic, though his attempts to prove anything often collapse.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_1#'s love interest. She, too, is fairly uncommitted to anything and does not mind the presence of the rhinoceroses. Nevertheless, she is the one other character of proportion in the play that has an emotional life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a senior member of #X_2#'s office. He is cynical and skeptical, and jealous of #X_3#'s rising stature. He refuses to believe at first the presence of the rhinos and seeks rational explanations for everything.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a co-worker of #X_1#'s and a rival for #X_2#'s affections. He prides himself on his intellect and rationality.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the head of #Y_0#'s office. He privileges work above his employees.

-- #X_0# --
Mr. #X_1#, another co-worker of #Y_0#, appears off-stage only as a rhinoceros. His wife remains devoted to him despite his new form.

-- #X_0# --
The Old Gentleman, the Grocer, the Grocer's Wife, the Housewife, the Café Proprietor, and the Waitress appear in the first act. They are characterized largely by their trivial concerns, though the Old Gentleman is very interested in the Logician.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# of #Y_0# when the play begins, #X_0# is a young man who has not matured much since his adolescence. Stately and poetic, he enjoys the trappings of kingship and has an extraordinary flair for poetic language. However, he is disconnected from his land and its people. He is overthrown by his cousin, #X_1#, and eventually assassinated in the remote castle of #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
In some texts, thanks to the vagaries of Renaissance spelling, #X_0# is called "#X_2#," and #X_0# is "#X_4#." He is also occasionally referred to by his nickname, "#X_3#." #X_0# is King #X_7#'s cousin and the son of #X_7#'s uncle, #X_5#. He is less poetic but far more pragmatic and capable than his cousin. He returns from his banishment abroad, sways the loyalties of both the English nobility and the common people to his side, and stages a revolution against #X_7# II. He is eventually crowned King #X_0# IV.

-- #X_0# --
Called either "#X_0#" or "#X_0#." An important nobleman, #X_0# of #X_0# is #X_2#'s uncle and the father of #X_2#'s banished cousin Bolingbroke, who eventually usurps the throne. #X_0# is very old when this play begins, and he dies in Act II, scene i, after his son's banishment--but not before delivering a withering curse on #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
Called "#X_0#." #X_2#'s uncle, and a brother of John of Gaunt and of the late #X_3# of Gloucester. He is made Lord Governor of England by King #X_2# while he is away at war, but is eventually convinced by #X_1# to defect and join his rebel army. A traditionalist who is loyally devoted to the crown, he is deeply upset by any kind of treason against the crown.

-- #X_0# --
Also called "#X_7#" late in the play, since he is the Earl of #X_7#. He is the son of #X_2#, #X_0# of York, and thus a cousin to both King #X_5# II and #X_3#. He remains loyal to #X_5# throughout the war and, after #X_5#'s deposition, is involved in a failed scheme against the life of the newly crowned King #X_4#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, sometimes called "#X_0#," is a nobleman whom Henry #X_2# accuses, early in the play, of treason against the state and of complicity in the earlier death of #X_0#, #X_0# of Gloucester (the uncle of the current King). #X_0# is banished at the same time as #X_2# and dies in exile.

-- #X_0# --
#X_5#'s friends and loyal backers in the court. #X_3# and #X_0#e are trapped by #X_2# and executed in Act II, scene ii; #X_0# also captured, turns informer in Act IV, scene i and apparently survives the play. (These three names are sometimes mentioned alongside that of the mysterious Earl of Wiltshire, a character whom #X_6# apparently meant to be another of #X_5#'s friends but failed to write into any actual scenes.)

-- #X_0# --
Noblemen who join Bolingbroke's rebel army early to fight against King Richard. Northumberland (occasionally called "#X_0#") is the father of young Harry #X_0# (also called "#X_0#").

-- #X_0# --
The wife of the Duke of #X_0# and mother of #X_3#. She goes before King #X_2# to plead for her son's life.

-- #X_0# --
The aged widow of the late #X_3# of #X_0#, and the sister-in-law of #X_2# and #X_4#. She resides in a house at Plashy. We learn of her death in Act II, scene ii.

-- #X_0# --
King #X_2#'s wife. She was born into the French royal family and flees to #Y_0# when #X_2# is deposed.

-- #X_0# --
Called "#X_0#." He does not appear in the play, but is a powerful figure to whom other characters frequently refer. The Lord Steward of the king's household, he is also the brother of Henry #X_0# #X_0# of #X_5#, and thus the uncle of young #X_3#. When #X_5# is declared a traitor for having joined #X_2#'s army, #X_0# also resigns his stewardship and defects to #X_2#, taking the servants of the king's house with him.

-- #X_0# --
The ruler of #X_0# Castle in #Y_1#, where #X_2#'s army meets #X_1#'s army in Act II, scene iii. He is loyal to King Richard.

-- #X_0# --
A lord loyal to King #X_2#. After trying unsuccessfully to manage #X_2#'s troops in #Y_1#, he joins #X_2# in #Y_1# after #X_2# returns from #Y_0#. He is later beheaded for his part in the conspiracy against the life of the newly crowned King #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A clergyman loyal to #X_2#. He speaks out against #X_1#'s usurpation of the throne in Act IV, scene i, for which he is arrested. He is later indicted in the conspiracy against King Henry's life, but the King pardons him and sends him away from the court.

-- #X_0# --
A nobleman loyal to #X_2#. He brings #X_2# the bad news of #X_1#'s invasion when #X_2# returns from #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A clergyman loyal to #X_2#. He is beheaded for his participation in the conspiracy against King Henry's life.

-- #X_0# --
A nobleman who assassinates the former King #X_1# in #Y_0# in Act V, scene v, believing he is acting under King Henry's orders

-- #X_0# --
A minor lord who throws down a gage sometime during Act IV, scene i, and also throws his weight around in Act V, scene vi

-- #X_0# --
Also called the duke of #Y_0#, and eventually crowned King #X_0# III. Deformed in body and twisted in mind, #X_0# is both the central character and the villain of the play. He is evil, corrupt, sadistic, and manipulative, and he will stop at nothing to become king. His intelligence, political brilliance, and dazzling use of language keep the audience fascinated—and his subjects and rivals under his thumb.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s right-hand man in his schemes to gain power. The duke of #X_0# is almost as amoral and ambitious as #X_1# himself.

-- #X_0# --
The older brother of #X_4# and #X_2#, and the king of #Y_0# at the start of the play. #X_0# was deeply involved in the #X_5#’ brutal overthrow of the #X_3# regime, but as king he is devoted to achieving a reconciliation among the various political factions of his reign. He is unaware that #X_4# attempts to thwart him at every turn.

-- #X_0# --
The gentle, trusting brother born between #X_1# and #X_2# in the #X_3# family. #X_2# has #X_0# murdered in order to get him out of the way. #X_0# leaves two children, a son and a daughter.

-- #X_0# --
The wife of King #X_3# IV and the mother of the two young princes (the heirs to the throne) and their older sister, young #X_0#. After #X_3#’s death, #X_0# (also called Lady #X_5#) is at #X_6#’s mercy. #X_6# rightly views her as an enemy because she opposes his rise to power, and because she is intelligent and fairly strong-willed. #X_0# is part of the #X_8# family; her kinsmen—#X_2#, #X_7#, and #X_5#—are her allies in the court.

-- #X_0# --
The kinsmen and allies of #X_2#, and members of the #X_5# and #X_0# families. #X_4# is #X_2#’s brother, while #X_0# and #X_1# are her sons from her first marriage. #X_3# eventually executes #X_4# and #X_0#, but #X_1# flees and survives.

-- #X_0# --
The young widow of Prince #X_1#, who was the son of the former king, #X_2#. Lady #X_0# hates #X_3# for the death of her husband, but for reasons of politics—and for sadistic pleasure—#X_3# persuades #X_0# to marry him.

-- #X_0# --
Widowed mother of #X_4#, #X_1#, and King #X_2#. The duchess of #X_0# is #X_3#’s mother-in-law, and she is very protective of #X_3# and her children, who are the duchess’s grandchildren. She is angry with, and eventually curses, #X_4# for his heinous actions.

-- #X_0# --
Widow of the dead King #X_2#, and mother of the slain Prince #X_1#. In medieval times, when kings were deposed, their children were often killed to remove any threat from the royal line of descent—but their wives were left alive because they were considered harmless. #X_0# was the wife of the king before #X_1#, the Lancastrian #X_2#, who was subsequently deposed and murdered (along with their children) by the family of King #X_1# IV and #X_5#. She is embittered and hates both #X_5# and the people he is trying to get rid of, all of whom were complicit in the destruction of the #X_4#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# two young sons of King #X_2# IV and his wife, #X_4#, their names are actually Prince #X_2# and the young duke of #Y_1#, but they are often referred to collectively. Agents of #X_6# murder these boys—#X_6#’s nephews—in #Y_2#. Young Prince #X_2#, the rightful heir to the throne, should not be confused with the elder #X_2#, prince of #Y_0# (the first husband of Lady #X_1#, and the son of the former king, #X_5#.), who was killed before the play begins.

-- #X_0# --
The former Queen #X_0#’s daughter. #X_0# enjoys the fate of many Renaissance noblewomen. She becomes a pawn in political power-brokering, and is promised in marriage at the end of the play to #X_1#, the Lancastrian rebel leader, in order to unite the warring houses of #Y_1# and #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
Two of #X_2#’s flunkies among the nobility.

-- #X_0# --
A murderer whom #X_2# hires to kill his young cousins, the princes in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A member of a branch of the #X_1# royal family. #X_0# gathers a force of rebels to challenge #X_2# for the throne. He is meant to represent goodness, justice, and fairness—all the things #X_2# does not. #X_0# is portrayed in such a glowing light in part because he founded the #X_4# dynasty, which still ruled #Y_0# in #X_3#’s day.

-- #X_0# --
A lord who maintains his integrity, remaining loyal to the family of King #X_2#. #X_0# winds up dead for making the mistake of trusting #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The stepfather of #X_3#. Lord #X_0#, earl of #Y_0#, secretly helps #X_3#, although he cannot escape #X_2#’s watchful gaze.

-- #X_0# --
A gullible and suggestible fellow whom #X_2# and #X_1# use as a pawn in their ploy to make #X_2# king.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_3#, #X_2#, #X_6#, and #X_4# who is executed by Richard along with #X_6# and #X_5#.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator of the story. A convicted murderer serving a life sentence, #X_0# writes the story to try to make sense of his friendship with #X_2#, his life in prison, and his hopes for the future. #X_0# is a key figure inside prison, a lifeline to the outside world who can smuggle almost anything into the prison—for a price. Once paroled, he struggles with his newfound freedom, dissatisfied with his job and still without hope for a better future.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist. The former vice president of a bank in #Y_1#, #Y_0#, #X_0# is thirty years old when he arrives at #Y_2# and approximately fifty-eight when he escapes. A short, neat, meticulous man with sandy blond hair, he has small hands and wears gold-rimmed glasses. Most of the other inmates think that #X_0# is cold and snobbish because he’s always so calm and composed, rarely revealing his inner thoughts or true character. #X_0# eventually becomes the prison librarian and financial wizard, offering free tax advice to guards and wardens in exchange for protection and favors. He’s one of the few innocent inmates at #Y_2#.

-- #X_0# --
One of the prison wardens. #X_0# institutes the new “Inside-Out” program that forces prisoners to work on chain gains to repair roads and public buildings. Even though he claims to be a devout Baptist, he accepts bribes from local construction companies so that the Inside-Out program won’t put them out of business. He uses #X_1#’s financial expertise to hide his illegal earnings and therefore refuses to help #X_1# win a retrial. #X_0# eventually resigns in disgrace after #X_1#’s escape.

-- #X_0# --
A prison guard. A tall man with thinning red hair, #X_0# speaks loudly and uses the threat of violence to control the prisoners. Pessimistic, cynical, and paranoid, he feels the world is out to get him, even when he inherits $35,000 from a long-lost brother. #X_1#’s offer to help #X_0# avoid paying taxes on the money marks the beginning of #X_1#’s career as the prison’s financial wizard. #X_0# eventually has a heart attack and retires.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# gang of inmates who prey on weaker prisoners. #X_0#, including inmates #X_2# and #X_3#, maintain their dominance in the hierarchy of prisoners by beating and gang-raping new inmates, including #X_1#. #X_1# always fights back even though he usually loses. #X_1# eventually wins protection from the #X_0# after helping the guards and wardens with their finances.

-- #X_0# --
A young inmate. A career criminal, #X_0# has served time in another prison with #X_2#, the man who privately admits to killing #X_1#’s wife and her lover. #X_0# offers to help #X_1# prove his innocence, but #X_3# transfers #X_0# to a minimum-security prison to keep #X_1# from leaving #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A survivor of the apocalyptic event and the protagonist of the story. #X_0# man is gentle and caring with his son, but prone to outbursts of anger or frustration. He is a survivalist, whose instincts have kept him and the boy alive on the road. #X_0# man certainly thinks about God and religion, though he is not evidently a religious person. #X_0# man lives now only for the life of his son.

-- #X_0# --
A child born shortly after the apocalyptic event. #X_0# boy depends on his father for survival but shows a strong tendency toward mercy throughout the story. #X_0# boy advocates for helping almost every person the father and son meet on the road. #X_0# boy’s fixation with a little boy he claims to see in a burned-out city may be a reflection of himself. #X_0# boy expresses a strong desire to take care of the boy, hinting that he desires to be taken care of as well.

-- #X_0# --
A survivor of the apocalyptic event who gives birth to the boy. #X_0# woman expresses an anti-survivalist perspective before ultimately killing herself. She scoffs when the man says they are “survivors” of the catastrophe. Instead, she believes that they should be dead already, to avoid the inevitable horrors of rape, slavery, and murder as human society breaks down.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# apparition of a small child seen by the boy. #X_0# boy fixates on the little boy and worries about him, while the father disbelieves that the little boy actually exists. A strong example of the growing divide between father and son, the boy worries over the little boy while the man discourages his son from desiring to help others.

-- #X_0# --
An old man with poor vision traveling on the road, and a reference to the prophet Eli from the Book of Samuel. In the story, #X_2# serves to reflect the boy’s kindness and reveal the growing separation between father and son. #X_2# is ambivalent to the help the boy offers him and speaks strangely with the man on the nature of death.

-- #X_0# --
A man who steals everything from the father and son. #X_0# father takes everything back from the thief at gunpoint and then takes the thief’s clothes and shoes as well. #X_0# boy later accuses the man of killing the thief by taking everything from him.

-- #X_0# --
A man who rescues the boy after the father has died. Described as a “veteran of old skirmishes,” the scarred man carries a shotgun and interrogates the boy about his dead father and what the boy will do next. #X_0# boy asks the scarred man whether or not he eats people, and whether or not he is “one of the good guys.” It turns out the man is kind-hearted and takes the boy home to meet a motherly woman who embraces him.

-- #X_0# --
A mother who embraces the boy at the end of the story. She talks to the boy about God, but the boy is reticent, saying he only talks to his father, now dead. #X_0# woman is conciliatory on this point, drawing a connection between God and men.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s protagonist and narrator. #X_0# begins the novel as a young middle-class man in #Y_0# in search of a career. He father recommends the law, but #X_0# yearns for a life at sea, and his subsequent rebellion and decision to become a merchant is the starting point for the whole adventure that follows. His vague but recurring feelings of guilt over his disobedience color the first part of the first half of the story and show us how deep #X_0#’s religious fear is. #X_0# is steady and plodding in everything he does, and his perseverance ensures his survival through storms, enslavement, and a twenty-eight-year isolation on a desert island.

-- #X_0# --
A twenty-six-year-old Caribbean native and cannibal who converts to Protestantism under #X_1#’s tutelage. #X_0# becomes #X_1#’s servant after #X_1# saves his life when #X_0# is about to be eaten by other cannibals. #X_0# never appears to resist or resent his new servitude, and he may sincerely view it as appropriate compensation for having his life saved. But whatever #X_0#’s response may be, his servitude has become a symbol of imperialist oppression throughout the modern world. #X_0#’s overall charisma works against the emotional deadness that many readers find in #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# sea #X_0# who picks up #X_1# and the slave boy #X_2# from their boat after they escape from their Moorish captors and float down the African coast. #X_0# takes #X_1# to #Y_0# and thus inaugurates #X_1#’s new life as plantation owner. #X_0# is never named—unlike #X_2#, for example—and his anonymity suggests a certain uninteresting blandness in his role in the novel. He is polite, personable, and extremely generous to #X_1#, buying the animal skins and the slave boy from #X_1# at well over market value. He is loyal as well, taking care of #X_1#’s #Y_0#ian investments even after a twenty-eight-year absence. His role in #X_1#’s life is crucial, since he both arranges for #X_1#’s new career as a plantation owner and helps #X_1# cash in on the profits later.

-- #X_0# --
One of the men from the Spanish ship that is wrecked off #X_2#’s island, and whose crew is rescued by the cannibals and taken to a neighboring island. #X_0# is doomed to be eaten as a ritual victim of the cannibals when #X_2# saves him. In exchange, he becomes a new “subject” in #X_2#’s “kingdom,” at least according to #X_2#. #X_0# is never fleshed out much as a character in #X_2#’s narrative, an example of the odd impersonal attitude often notable in #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A nonwhite (Arab or black) slave boy only briefly introduced during the period of #X_1#’s enslavement in #Y_0#. When #X_1# escapes with two other slaves in a boat, he forces one to swim to shore but keeps #X_0# on board, showing a certain trust toward the boy. #X_0# never betrays that trust. Nevertheless, when the Portuguese captain eventually picks them up, #X_1# sells #X_0# to the captain. #X_0#’s sale shows us the racist double standards sometimes apparent in #X_1#’s behavior.

-- #X_0# --
Appearing briefly, but on two separate occasions in the novel, the #X_0# keeps #X_1#’s 200 pounds safe in #Y_0# throughout all his thirty-five years of journeying. She returns it loyally to #X_1# upon his return to #Y_0# and, like the Portuguese captain and Friday, reminds us of the goodwill and trustworthiness of which humans can be capable, whether European  or not.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator and protagonist. #X_0# is the second-oldest #X_0# child. She has a fiery temper like her #X_1#. Also, she is very naive concerning the facts of racism.

-- #X_0# --
A meticulously neat first-grader, #X_0# #X_0# is the youngest of the #X_3# children.

-- #X_0# --
A thirteen-year-old boy, #X_0# is the oldest of the #X_0# children. He is part-adult, part-child.

-- #X_0# --
A cheerful seven-year-old, #X_0# is the second youngest of the #X_1# children. He is timid.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s father. He values his independence highly, leaving to work on the railroad in order not to lose ownership of #Y_0# land.

-- #X_0# --
Cassie's mother, a schoolteacher.

-- #X_0# --
Papa's brother, #X_0# lives in #Y_0#. He has a short temper.

-- #X_0# --
Papa's mother. A woman of sixty, she runs the #X_2# farm.

-- #X_0# --
A trouble-making friend of #X_4#'s. The #X_1# are sharecroppers on #X_3# land. #X_0# #X_0# has a younger brother named #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A white boy who is often beaten for walking to school with and associating with the #X_3# children. His sister is #X_2#, who is often rude to #X_1#. He has two big brothers, #X_4# and #X_5#, who use #Y_0# pretending they are his friend.

-- #X_0# --
A prissy seventh grader.

-- #X_0# --
The older #X_0# brothers make trouble. They pretend to befriend #X_3#, but make fun of him behind his back.

-- #X_0# --
A big, burly man with streaks of white hair who comes to work on the #X_1# farm.

-- #X_0# --
A local lawyer; a white man. His forefathers bought land from #X_1# during the reconstruction, and sold some of it to the #X_2# family. #X_0# is very sympathetic to the plight of the black community.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0# family runs a general store on #X_2# land. #X_0#y are violent, brutal people.

-- #X_0# --
A rich plantation owner who is anxious to buy back the #X_1#'s land.

-- #X_0# --
The son and heir of #X_6# and Lady #X_6#. A young man of about sixteen, #X_0# is handsome, intelligent, and sensitive. Though impulsive and immature, his idealism and passion make him an extremely likable character. He lives in the middle of a violent feud between his family and the #X_2#, but he is not at all interested in violence. His only interest is love. At the beginning of the play he is madly in love with a woman named #X_7#, but the instant he lays eyes on #X_3#, he falls in love with her and forgets #X_7#. Thus, #X_8# gives us every reason to question how real #X_0#’s new love is, but #X_0# goes to extremes to prove the seriousness of his feelings. He secretly marries #X_3#, the daughter of his father’s worst enemy; he happily takes abuse from #X_9#; and he would rather die than live without his beloved. #X_0# is also an affectionate and devoted friend to his relative #X_1#, #X_5#, and Friar #X_4#.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of #X_2# and Lady #X_2#. A beautiful thirteen-year-old girl, #X_0# begins the play as a naïve child who has thought little about love and marriage, but she grows up quickly upon falling in love with #X_3#, the son of her family’s great enemy. Because she is a girl in an aristocratic family, she has none of the freedom #X_3# has to roam around the city, climb over walls in the middle of the night, or get into swordfights. Nevertheless, she shows amazing courage in trusting her entire life and future to #X_3#, even refusing to believe the worst reports about him after he gets involved in a fight with her cousin. #X_0#’s closest friend and confidant is her nurse, though she’s willing to shut the Nurse out of her life the moment the Nurse turns against #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
A Franciscan friar, friend to both #X_2# and #X_1#. Kind, civic-minded, a proponent of moderation, and always ready with a plan, #X_0# secretly marries the impassioned lovers in hopes that the union might eventually bring peace to #Y_0#. As well as being a Catholic holy man, #X_0# is also an expert in the use of seemingly mystical potions and herbs.

-- #X_0# --
A kinsman to the Prince, and #X_1#’s close friend. One of the most extraordinary characters in all of #X_2#’s plays, #X_0# overflows with imagination, wit, and, at times, a strange, biting satire and brooding fervor. #X_0# loves wordplay, especially sexual double entendres. He can be quite hotheaded, and hates people who are affected, pretentious, or obsessed with the latest fashions. He finds #X_1#’s romanticized ideas about love tiresome and tries to convince #X_1# to view love as a simple matter of sexual appetite.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s nurse, the woman who breast-fed #X_1# when she was a baby and has cared for #X_1# her entire life. A vulgar, long-winded, and sentimental character, the #X_0# provides comic relief with her frequently inappropriate remarks and speeches. But, until a disagreement near the play’s end, the #X_0# is #X_1#’s faithful confidante and loyal intermediary in #X_1#’s affair with #X_2#. She provides a contrast with #X_1#, given that her view of love is earthy and sexual, whereas #X_1# is idealistic and intense. #X_0# believes in love and wants #X_1# to have a nice-looking husband, but the idea that #X_1# would want to sacrifice herself for love is incomprehensible to her.

-- #X_0# --
A #X_1#, #X_2#’s cousin on her mother’s side. Vain, fashionable, supremely aware of courtesy and the lack of it, he becomes aggressive, violent, and quick to draw his sword when he feels his pride has been injured. Once drawn, his sword is something to be feared. He loathes #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The patriarch of the #X_0# family, father of #X_1#, husband of Lady #X_0#, and enemy, for unexplained reasons, of #X_2#. He truly loves his daughter, though he is not well acquainted with #X_1#’s thoughts or feelings, and seems to think that what is best for her is a “good” match with #Y_0#. Often prudent, he commands respect and propriety, but he is liable to fly into a rage when either is lacking.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s mother, #X_0#’s wife. A woman who herself married young (by her own estimation she gave birth to #X_2# at close to the age of fourteen), she is eager to see her daughter marry #Y_0#. She is an ineffectual mother, relying on the Nurse for moral and pragmatic support.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
Romeo’s mother, #X_0#’s wife. She dies of grief after Romeo is exiled from Verona.

-- #X_0# --
A kinsman of the #X_3#, and the suitor of #X_2# most preferred by #X_1#. Once #X_1# has promised him he can marry #X_2#, he behaves very presumptuous toward her, acting as if they are already married.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s nephew, #X_4#’s cousin and thoughtful friend. #X_0# makes a genuine effort to defuse violent scenes in public places, though #X_2# accuses him of having a nasty temper in private. He spends most of the play trying to help #X_4# get his mind off #X_5#, even after #X_4# has fallen in love with #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# of #Y_1#. A kinsman of #X_1# and #Y_0#. As the seat of political power in #Y_1#, he is concerned about maintaining the public peace at all costs.

-- #X_0# --
A Franciscan friar charged by #X_0# #X_2# with taking the news of #X_1#’s false death to #X_3# in #Y_0#. #X_0# is held up in a quarantined house, and the message never reaches #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
Montague’s servant, who fights with Sampson and Gregory in the first scene of the play.

-- #X_0# --
An apothecary in Mantua. Had he been wealthier, he might have been able to afford to value his morals more than money, and refused to sell poison to Romeo.

-- #X_0# --
A #X_1# servant who invites guests to #X_1#’s feast and escorts the Nurse to meet with #X_2#. He is illiterate, and a bad singer.

#X_0#n imagined male author, whose work is overshadowed by a looming self-consciousness and petulant self-assertiveness.

-- #X_0# --
A young woman from #Y_0# who doesn't know what she wants. Her piano skills show that she has potential for great passions and the ability to recognize truth even if it means breaking the social codes that are expected of her. She grows into a woman through the course of the book, choosing to follow the true instincts of love (as represented by #X_2#) over the tedious falsities perpetuated by pretentious upper class society (as represented in #X_1#).

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s older, poorer cousin and an old maid, #X_0# accompanies #X_2# to #Y_0# as a chaperone, and attempts to uphold what is "proper."

-- #X_0# --
A young man with a passionate desire for truth, and at the beginning of the book, a faltering hopelessness that life is not actually worth living. Though he is of a lower social class, he falls in love with #X_2# in #Y_0#, and she becomes a beacon of hope to him in his search for joy and meaning. He encourages her not to marry #X_1# and helps her to follow the true ways of her heart.

-- #X_0# --
Described, alternately, as being both ungentlemanly and beautiful, #X_0# means well but constantly offends proper societal conventions with his abrupt manner of speaking and his blatant honestly. An avid reader, he espouses liberal values, and also plays a role in helping #X_1# to surrender herself to her true desires even if it means violating social taboos. His wife is dead.

-- #X_0# --
The dislikable man who becomes #X_1#'s fiance for a short period of time. #X_0# is pretentious and despises all the country people of #X_1#'s town, finding them unsophisticated and coarse in comparison to the affluent #Y_0# society he is used to. He sees #X_1# not for herself but as an abstract vision that he has hung upon her. He treats people without kindness or respect. #X_0# tries to be authoritarian and manly, but is actually awkward and self-conscious.

-- #X_0# --
An ostentatious writer who also stays in the same pension in #Y_0#, and hopes to write novels about Italian life. She is outspoken and clever, but also abrasive.

After a life of having potential suitors rejected by her father, she spends time after his death with a newcomer, #X_1# Barron, although the chances of his marrying her decrease as the years pass. Bloated and pallid in her later years, her hair turns steel gray. She ultimately poisons #X_1# and seals his corpse into an upstairs room.

-- #X_0# --
A foreman from the North. #X_0# is a large man with a dark complexion, a booming voice, and light-colored eyes. A gruff and demanding boss, he wins many admirers in #X_2# because of his gregarious nature and good sense of humor. He develops an interest in #X_1# and takes her for Sunday drives in a yellow-wheeled buggy. Despite his attributes, the townspeople view him as a poor, if not scandalous, choice for a mate. He disappears in #X_1#’s house and decomposes in an attic bedroom after she kills him.

-- #X_0# --
A mayor of #Y_0#. Eighty years old, #X_0# attempts to delicately handle the complaints about the smell emanating from the #X_2# property. To be respectful of #X_1#’s pride and former position in the community, he and the aldermen decide to sprinkle lime on the property in the middle of the night.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s father. #X_0# is a controlling, looming presence even in death, and the community clearly sees his lasting influence over #X_1#. He deliberately thwarts #X_1#’s attempts to find a husband in order to keep her under his control. We get glimpses of him in the story: in the crayon portrait kept on the gilt-edged easel in the parlor, and silhouetted in the doorway, horsewhip in hand, having chased off another of #X_1#’s suitors.

-- #X_0# --
A number of critics have read #X_4#'s #X_0# as an allegory for the work of art as such. Born of painting, literature, and drama, she would incarnate the beauty of artifice, ornament, and luxury. Importantly, however, this seductive spectacle is also a harbinger of death. #X_0# first appears disgusted by the court, mortified by its crude, painted guests and the incestuous gaze of her stepfather, #X_1#. Soon thereafter she is seduced by the imprisoned prophet #X_2#'s voice and has him drawn from his tomb, transgressing the order of the #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The Tetrarch of Judea, #X_0# is #X_0#ias's second husband and Salomé's stepfather. #X_0# deposed, imprisoned, and executed Salomé's father—his own elder brother the former king—and wedded #X_0#ias in what Jokanaan calls an incestuous union. #X_0# is in fear of Jokanaan, whom he has imprisoned, as he cannot know if Jokanaan speaks the word of God and if his many prophecies of his ruin will come to pass. He is also tormented by a host of omens—the blood in which he slips, the beating wings of the angel of death, his burning and bloody garland—that foretell the death about to strike the palace.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#—#X_5#'s Saint John the Baptist—is the prophet imprisoned in a tomb-like cistern at the orders of the #X_4#. "Terrible to look at", he spends much of the play in his subterranean prison, figuring as a mad, booming voice that prophecies the ruin of the kingdom, curses the royal family, and proclaims the coming of #X_1#. He appears on-stage and takes corporeal form, against his wishes, at #X_3#'s lustful call. As a mystic, #X_0#is a tabooed body: #X_2# bans others from seeing him, and he himself—as #X_3# learns—refuses to suffer the gaze of the cursed. He is also "blind" in a sense, failing to see those around him in his inspiration by the divine word.

-- #X_0# --
The proud, hard queen of Judaea, #X_0# abhors Jokanaan, who has slandered her as an incestuous harlot and remains alive against her wishes. She also suffers the indignity of #X_1#'s incestuous lust for #X_2#, hopelessly reproaching him for his gaze. Unlike most of the cast, characterized by its propensity for finding symbolism and the omen in particular in the world, #X_0# appears to scorn the symbol. Thus, for example, when #X_1# sees a madwoman in the moon, she can only scoff: "the moon is like the moon, that is all". According to Jokanaan, #X_0# is also guilty of a crime of sight, having "seen the images of Chaldeans limned in colors" and given herself up "unto the lust of her eyes".

-- #X_0# --
A former prince and captain of #X_2#'s guard, the #X_0# is a handsome, languorous youth utterly entranced by #X_4#. Thus he raises #X_3# from his cistern at her request and kills himself when she professes her love for the prophet.

#X_0# is a Roman official who provides Herod with news of Rome and Caesar.

-- #X_0# --

#X_0# is the book’s protagonist and the wearer of the scarlet letter that gives the book its title. The letter, a patch of fabric in the shape of an “A,” signifies that #X_0# is an “adulterer.” As a young woman, #X_0# married an elderly scholar, #X_1#, who sent her ahead to #Y_0# to live but never followed her. While waiting for him, she had an affair with a Puritan minister named #X_2#, after which she gave birth to #X_3#. #X_0# is passionate but also strong—she endures years of shame and scorn. She equals both her husband and her lover in her intelligence and thoughtfulness. Her alienation puts her in the position to make acute observations about her community, particularly about its treatment of women.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s illegitimate daughter #X_0# is a young girl with a moody, mischievous spirit and an ability to perceive things that others do not. For example, she quickly discerns the truth about her mother and #Y_0#. The townspeople say that she barely seems human and spread rumors that her unknown father is actually the Devil. She is wise far beyond her years, frequently engaging in ironic play having to do with her mother’s scarlet letter.

-- #X_0# --
“#X_0#” is actually #X_1#’s husband in disguise. He is much older than she is and had sent her to #Y_0# while he settled his affairs in Europe. Because he is captured by Native #Y_0#ns, he arrives in #Y_1# belatedly and finds #X_1# and her illegitimate child being displayed on the scaffold. He lusts for revenge, and thus decides to stay in #Y_1# despite his wife’s betrayal and disgrace. He is a scholar and uses his knowledge to disguise himself as a doctor, intent on discovering and tormenting #X_1#’s anonymous lover. #X_0# is self-absorbed and both physically and psychologically monstrous. His single-minded pursuit of retribution reveals him to be the most malevolent character in the novel.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a young man who achieved fame in #Y_1# as a theologian and then emigrated to #Y_0#. In a moment of weakness, he and #X_1# became lovers. Although he will not confess it publicly, he is the father of her child. He deals with his guilt by tormenting himself physically and psychologically, developing a heart condition as a result. #X_0# is an intelligent and emotional man, and his sermons are thus masterpieces of eloquence and persuasiveness. His commitments to his congregation are in constant conflict with his feelings of sinfulness and need to confess.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a wealthy, elderly gentleman who spends much of his time consulting with the other town fathers. Despite his role as governor of a fledgling American society, he very much resembles a traditional English aristocrat. #X_0# tends to strictly adhere to the rules, but he is easily swayed by #X_1#’s eloquence. He remains blind to the misbehaviors taking place in his own house: his sister, Mistress #X_2#, is a witch.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a widow who lives with her brother, Governor #X_1#, in a luxurious mansion. She is commonly known to be a witch who ventures into the forest at night to ride with the “Black Man.” Her appearances at public occasions remind the reader of the hypocrisy and hidden evil in Puritan society.

-- #X_0# --
#Y_0#’s elder clergyman, #X_0# #X_0# is scholarly yet grandfatherly. He is a stereotypical Puritan father, a literary version of the stiff, starkly painted portraits of American patriarchs. Like Governor #X_2#, #X_0# follows the community’s rules strictly but can be swayed by #X_3#’s eloquence. Unlike #X_3#, his junior colleague, #X_0# preaches hellfire and damnation and advocates harsh punishment of sinners.

-- #X_0# --
The unnamed narrator works as the surveyor of #Y_1# some two hundred years after the novel’s events take place. He discovers an old manuscript in the building’s attic that tells the story of #X_1#; when he loses his job, he decides to write a fictional treatment of the narrative. The narrator is a rather high-strung man, whose Puritan ancestry makes him feel guilty about his writing career. He writes because he is interested in #Y_0#n history and because he believes that #Y_0# needs to better understand its religious and moral heritage.

-- #X_0# --
A devil and the fictional author of The #X_0# Letters. #X_0# is an experienced tempter. He has been assigned, or perhaps , to give his nephew #X_4# advice about how to win the soul of an unnamed British manthe Patientinto #X_1#. #X_0# often refers to #X_4#, his nephew, with terms of endearment. By his own account, #X_0# has won many souls for #X_1#.  He seems to be a mid-level bureaucrat within #X_1#’s corporate structure. Sometimes, the reader learns, #X_0# undergoes a sudden transformation into a giant millipede. There are far higher-ranking devils then #X_0#but #X_0# is apparently important enough to have his own secretary, #X_3#, who takes dictation when #X_0# is in millipede form. Despite #X_0#’s successes, he is angry and embittered, critical of #X_1#’s bureaucracy and of #X_4#. He often reprimands #X_4# for making mistakes with the Patient, and, after #X_4# fails to win the Patient for #X_1#, #X_0# is eager to eat a piece of him as punishment for failure.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s nephew and the devil assigned to tempt the #X_2#. Many Christians are familiar with the idea of a guardian angelan angel assigned by God to watch over a person and help him or her through life’s difficulties. #X_0# is the opposite, a kind of “guardian” devil, assigned to work on a particular human, the #X_2#, to tempt him into sin and, eventually, eternal damnation. #X_0# is excitable and, according to #X_3#, incompetent. He is distracted from his assignment by the excitement and horror of World War II. Because the war is violent and destructive, #X_0# thinks it is a good thing for #X_1#, but the more experienced #X_3# warns him that World War II is only marginally relevant to #X_0#’s work. #X_0# is malicious, and reports #X_3# to #X_1#’s authorities because #X_3# says that God really loves humans, which, in #X_1#, is heresy. He fails to win the #X_2# soul and is condemned to be eaten.

-- #X_0# --
A British man tempted by a devil named #X_2#. Many of the facts of the #X_0#’s life are vague. He has an elderly, difficult mother. He eventually falls in love with a Christian woman. #X_0#’s age is never specified, but he is unsure whether he will be called to serve during World War II, meaning he is probably in his midthirties. He is a convert to Christianity who is seeking to become closer to God. He enjoys reading, walks by an old mill, and other simple pleasures. He is deeply moral and concerned with doing good. His job, like his age, is never specified, but his unspecified duties place him in danger once the Germans begin to drop bombs on his English town. He eventually dies in an air raid, and is taken into the Enemy’s campthe kingdom of Heaven.

-- #X_0# --
A difficult person and a picky eater. #X_0# #X_0# mother is one of the main sources of temptation in the #X_0# life. #X_0# Patient finds her temperament to be overbearing. #X_0# demands the #X_0# #X_0# makes on his time and energy are a source of irritation. #X_1# uses the #X_0# #X_0# as an example of gluttony. This contradicts expectations, because the #X_0# #X_0# does not eat a lot. Instead, she obsesses over  and insists on only eating toast and drinking tea. This unreasonable and obsessive relationship to food, in #X_1#’s view, is no better than bingeeating.

-- #X_0# --
A Christian and the #X_2#’s love interest. #X_0# introduces the #X_2# to her family. #X_0#’s family’s good spirits and Christian lifestyle are a positive influence on the #X_2#. #X_3# detests the #X_0#. He sees her as the kind of human who would laugh at his existence and find him funny. #X_0# has had a privileged life. She has only known #Y_0#. #X_3# sees this as her one weakness. She is described as being virtuous, but not prudish. She knows how to take delight in both earthly and spiritual pleasures.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# Christian #X_1#. #X_1# is the “#X_0#” only from devils’ perspectives. #X_2# only refers to #X_1# as the #X_0#, and he seems to be represented mostly as an immaterial being. He is never physically described, but he is—as according to most Christian sects—one #X_1# in three Persons, the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. In #X_2#’s account of events, the #X_0# claims to unconditionally love mankind, but this love is a lie. #X_0#’s claim for unconditional love is, according to #X_2#, what made flee the #X_0#’s presence and established #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
Satan, the ruler of Hell. Screwtape refers to Satan mostly as “#X_0#,” a title that, within ordinary Christian tradition, is reserved only for #X_1#. In The Screwtape Letters, Screwtape depicts #X_0# (Satan) as just and correct, whereas the Enemy (#X_1#) is described as false and deceitful.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --

He struggles to find his voice as a writer in the shadow of his successful actress mother and her lover, the writer #X_3#, both of whom are members of the elite #Y_0#n intelligensia and artistic community. #X_0# is impatient, self- defeating and childish. His need for love and approval torments him. He attempts to create new forms in dramatic writing and literature that reflect the new wave of symbolist writing that emerged in #Y_0# during #X_2#'s time. His writing parodies #X_2#'s own work. #X_0# is a dreamer and a compassionate soul who fills the void of affection in his life with self-doubt.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, a protagonist of The Seagull is a renowned #Y_0#n actress who stars in grand, melodramatic plays. She is the mother of #X_3#, the lover of #X_4#, and the sister of #X_2#. Her arrival at #X_2#'s country estate is the highlight of the year for the workers there and her family. She is a member of the intelligensia and artistic community in #Y_0# to which her son, #X_3# longs to belong. Stubborn, vain, stingy, and beautiful, #X_0# is a selfish mother and doting lover. She loves attention and is not afraid to ask for it. Her competitive spirit selfishly discourages #X_3#'s creative spirit and contirbutes to her obsession with looking and feeling young.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a nineteen-year-old neighbor of #X_2#'s estate who grew up in an estate bordering the same lake that acts as a backdrop for the play. She is one of the four protagonists of the play. #X_0#'s mother died when she was young and left her fortune to her husband, #X_0#'s father, without leaving any inheritance for #X_0#. Her father remarried and put all of the money in her stepmother's name, contributing to #X_0#'s insecure future. The play characters talk about how cruel #X_0#'s father is to her and how #X_0# can only be in the company of #X_2#'s family when her father and stepmother do not know she is in their company. #X_0# is in love with #X_3# or perhaps in love with the idea that #X_3# can bring her close to his mother, an actress, which is what #X_0# wants to become. Naïve, smart, idealistic, and willing to take risks, #X_0# is a hopeless romantic who longs for a stage career. Her pursuit of #X_4#'s heart reveals her overestimated innocence by those around her and her ambitious side.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s lover, #X_0#, one of the four protagonists, is an esteemed Russian writer of fiction stories and novels. Like #X_2#, #X_0# is a member of the the elite Russian intelligensia and artistic community. He begins as a dutiful lover to #X_2# but becomes tempted by the youthful beauty, optimism, and flattery of #X_3#. #X_0#'s favorite hobby is fishing. He is an obsessive- compulsive writer and somewhat aloof to the family and friends on the estate, preferring to observe the surroundings for details for his stories or fishing in the lake than gossiping, bragging, philosophizing, or playing parlor games. #X_0# feels that he lost out on his youth and on youthful romantic experiences because he was so busy trying to seek out a writing career for himself in those days. He uses this as an excuse for having the affair with #X_3#. #X_0# is not directly competitive with the jealous #X_4#, but does not encourage him either. #X_0# often seems like a reluctant but acquiescing member of the clan.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a local doctor who was once a popular and handsome ladies' man. #X_0# often provides an outsider's perspective to the play for he functions almost as an audience member on stage. He is less vital to the desires and distresses on stage, but he is important as a fluid observer and commentator, confidant, and witness to the events. He has known #X_1#, #X_3#, and the rest for many years. #X_0# has affections for #X_2# but does not seem to be in love with her. Like #X_3#, #X_0# is a compassionate presence who respects #X_4#'s talent and attempts to soften the blow of #X_1#'s ego on her depressed son, #X_4#'s, spirit.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a local schoolteacher who is poor and must support his family at home while later supporting his new family with #X_1#.

A central theorist in outlining the principles of socialism and communism. With #X_3#, #X_0# developed a “materialist” interpretation of history that posited the proletariat, or working class, as the eventual winners of the ongoing class conflict. #X_2# faults #X_0# for suggesting that the institution of private property led by necessity to the inferiority of women. #X_0# believed that the Industrial Revolution would bring about the liberation of women, but he failed to take into account that women would be more oppressed than men.

An early follower of #X_2# who became known as one of the first psychoanalysts to introduce theories of female sexuality into public discourse.

A fourteenth-century nun who lived through the Black Death and one of the few positive examples #X_4# provides of a woman transcending her given options. #X_2# rejects #X_3# as a role model and instead praises #X_0# of #X_0#, whose benevolence and inner visions gave her authority over some of the most important men of her age, including two popes. She experienced numerous visions and ecstatic encounters with the divine, and was also known for her cogent writing style.

-- #X_0# --
One of the novel's two protagonists, #X_0#is a ten-year-old girl who, after the death of her parents in #Y_1#, is sent to live with her uncle in #Y_2#, #Y_0#. #X_0# changes drastically over the course of The Secret Garden: she evolves from a spoiled, unloved and unloving creature to a girl who is full of spirit and surrounded by friends. She begins the book as its central character, but is later displaced by #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The other of the novel's protagonists, #X_0#is Archibald #X_0#'s ten-year-old son and heir. He was born shortly after the death of his mother, and his father could not bear to look at him because of his resemblance to her. It is feared that he will grow to be a hunchback like his father, and he has been treated as an invalid since his birth. #X_0#'s childhood has been entirely bedridden, and his servants have been commanded to obey his every whim. As a result, #X_0# is extremely imperious and gloomy; when we first meet him, he is certain he is going to die. By novel's end, however, he too will have undergone a transformation: he will have become a vigorous optimist, and will have won his father's love. Both his and #X_3#'s conversions are effected by the magical properties inherent in the secret garden.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is alternately described as "a common moor boy" and "a #Y_0# angel"; he is both. Two years older than #X_1# and #X_3#, #X_0# has lived on Missel Moor his entire life, and has a uniquely intimate relationship with the land. He is described as looking like the god #X_4# (the god of ...): he has rosy cheeks, rough curly hair, and blue eyes precisely the same color as the sky over the moor; he even carries a set of pan-pipes. Like #X_4#, he has the power to charm both animals and people: all the creatures who come close to him are instantly tamed, and he counts a fox, a crow, and two wild squirrels among his pets. His power to tame creatures works on #X_1# and #X_3# as well, and is one of the central causes of their wondrous transformations. He is the brother of #X_2# and the son of #X_5#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s friend and maidservant, #X_0# is distinguished by her charming frankness and levelheaded approach to all aspects of life. Her simplicity and kindness are a great help to #X_1# upon the latter's arrival at #Y_0#. In her very ordinariness, #X_0# represents the goodness of all the people of #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is a gruff elderly gardener who is only permitted to stay at #Y_0# because he was a favorite of the late Mistress #X_2#. He introduces #X_3# to the robin redbreast, and helps the children keep the secret of the garden. #X_0# himself clandestinely tended the garden during the ten years in which it was locked, out of love and loyalty for the Mistress #X_2#. Although he is rather rough, #X_0#'s essential kindness is fundamental to his character.

-- #X_0# --
The master of #Y_0#, who suffers from a crooked spine and general ill health. He has been in a crushing depression ever since the death of his wife, ten years before the novel begins. #X_0# spends most of his time abroad, since he wants to see neither his house nor his son, #X_1#, because these remind him of his late wife. At novel's end, he undergoes a change of heart after his wife comes to him in a dream. Master #X_0# comes to embrace his son when he realizes that this latter is in perfect health.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s late wife, who died ten years before the outset of the novel. Her spirit is associated with both roses and the secret garden. Her portrait hangs in her son's room beneath a rose-colored curtain, and she is described by all who knew her as the gentlest, sweetest, and most beautiful of women. She represents an absent ideal.

-- #X_0# --
The mother of #X_4# and #X_2# (as well as of twelve other children), #X_0#functions as a symbol for the concept of motherhood itself. She is all-nurturing, all-knowing, and appears dressed in a hooded blue cloak like that of the Christian Virgin #X_5# (the mother of #X_3#). Both #X_5# and #X_1# express the wish that she were their mother; stories of her sustain each of them before their respective transformations.

-- #X_0# --
The head of the servants at #Y_0#, #X_0#is distinguished by her punctilious obedience of all of Master #X_1#'s odd rules. Beneath her rigid exterior, she, like all the people of #Y_1#, is basically kind. She and #X_2# were friends in their girlhood.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s brother and #X_2#'s uncle, he tends to #X_2# during the latter's illness. He is a bit stuffy and officious, and both #X_2# and #X_3# laugh at him at every opportunity. Described as a weak man, he half-hopes for #X_2#'s death so that he might inherit #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s protagonist and narrator. #X_0# is a fourteen-year-old white girl born on the Fourth of July in 1950. When she was four, she accidentally killed her mother, #X_4#. Along with her abusive father, #X_9#, whom she cannot call “Daddy,” she lives on a peach farm in rural #Y_0#. Isolated and insecure, #X_0# fears that she lacks all femininity and imagines that her mother is her guardian angel, watching over and loving her from beyond. #X_0# loves and trusts #X_8#, a black housekeeper who helped raise her, and she finds the racism so prevalent in the south confusing. Over the course of the novel, she grows into a loved and loving young woman, who sees beyond skin color.      #X_0#’s most prized possessions are a few things of her mother’s she found in her father’s attic: a picture of #X_4#, a wooden picture of a black #X_6#, and a pair of white gloves. She loves to write and hopes to one day become a writer. Late in the novel, she finds a close friend and stand-in mother in #X_2# #X_3# and her sisters, #X_5# and #X_7#. In addition, her femininity blooms when she realizes her attraction to #X_10#, a young black man who helps out on the #X_3# farm. #X_0# also finds herself enchanted by bees, first by those living inside the walls of her room and later by those on #X_2#’s farm.

-- #X_0# --
A middle-aged black woman who welcomes #X_3# into her home. #X_0# lives in a pink house in #Y_1#, #Y_0#, with her two sisters, #X_4# and #X_2#. Together, #X_4#, #X_2#, and #X_0# are known as “the calendar sisters.” #X_0# has chosen not to marry because she does not want to give up the autonomy of her independent womanhood. #X_0# works as a beekeeper and honey/beeswax manufacturer on a 28-acre farm she inherited from her grandfather. By selling honey, she supports herself and sisters, as well as #X_3# and #X_5#, once they come to stay at her house. #X_0# is a warm and loving lady, skinnier than #X_5# but still larger-than-life to #X_3#. As a young woman, #X_0# attended school and worked as a teacher, then she became a housekeeper in the home of #X_1#, #X_3#’s mother, when #X_1# was a child. #X_0# created an alternate religion for herself and her friends based around a statue of a black Mary that has been passed through generations of her family. She teaches #X_3# about this religion and spirituality in general, as well as about beekeeping and love.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s nanny and first friend. #X_0# is a black woman who originally worked as a peach picker in the fields belonging to #X_1#’s father. Six months after #X_1#’s mother died, #X_3# took #X_0# out of the fields and assigned her to taking care of #X_1#. She is a very large woman who often burps and speaks her mind clearly, openly, and without self-censorship. Proud and determined, #X_0# quickly stands up for herself, even in the face of violent, racist men. She loves #X_1#, helping to mediate between #X_1# and her abusive father, and she goes along somewhat reluctantly with #X_1#’s plans out of a combination of love and pity for the young girl. Later, she becomes close friends with #X_2# and easily becomes part of the #Y_0# religious community in #Y_1#. #X_0# did have a husband at one point, although she found him to be stupid.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s mother. #X_0# was shot accidentally by four-year-old #X_3#. At the time, she had already left #X_3# and #X_4# and gone to stay with her old housekeeper, #X_2#, in #Y_1#. #X_0# was an attractive and lively woman who became depressed living in #Y_0# and had trouble acting as a responsible mother.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s best friend and romantic interest. #X_4# is a junior at the black high school in #Y_0# and plays football for the school team. He is handsome and has one dimple when he smiles. He is ambitious and hopes to be a lawyer someday, although he has never heard of a black lawyer. Sensitive #X_4# forms an attachment to #X_3#, giving her gifts and positive attention. He works on the #X_2#’ farm to earn money for college, to buy a car, and to be self-reliant.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father. A peach farmer, T. #X_0# was once passionately in love with #X_2#’s mother, to whom he was married. After his wife left him and later died, he became a bitter and resentful man. He abuses and punishes #X_2# by making her kneel on dried grits, making fun of her attempts to better herself through reading, and refusing to offer her any signs of love. T. #X_0# takes out his general resentment and bitterness on #X_2#, the product of his lost love.

-- #X_0# --
Sister of #X_2# and #X_4# and part owner of the #X_0# farm. #X_0# finds it difficult to like #X_3# at first because she resents #X_2#’s involvement in the white world as a housekeeper for #X_3#’s mother. In her spare time, #X_0# volunteers as a cellist for the local hospital, where her music soothes dying patients. She is involved in a love affair with #X_5#, to whom she refuses to get married. Stubborn and strong-headed, #X_0# eventually shows herself to be kind and caring as well.

-- #X_0# --
Sister of #X_3# and #X_4# and a friend and roommate to #X_5#. #X_0# once had a twin sister, #X_2#, who was depressed and committed suicide at a young age. Since that time, #X_0# has become extremely sensitive and prone to depression. When sad, #X_0# sings the song “Oh! Susanna” and removes herself to spend time alone by a special wall she has constructed outside the house—her own “wailing wall.” A very warm person, #X_0# spends most of her time taking care of the #X_0# house by cooking and cleaning for the other ladies. She eventually kills herself in the river.

-- #X_0# --
A very tall man who courts #X_2#. #X_0# helps around the farm but lives elsewhere. He is kind to #X_3# and one of the few grown men in the novel that is gentle and honest.

-- #X_0# --
A group of African Americans who have created their own religion, based around the #X_2# statue of the black #X_0#.

He has left the country, which he likes, and has moved to a hotel in #Y_1# Upper West Side to ask for his father's assistance. He is a man who has had many an odd job after a stint in acting but ended up with a steady job in sales. However, he has been laid off from his sales job, he has a strained relationship with his father, he has been separated from his wife, he is in love with a woman he cannot marry, and he has invested the last of his money in a joint investment venture that is bound to failure. It is amid all of this that #X_0# finds himself on his "day of reckoning."

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s father. #X_0# is a difficult man who abides by the rules of a previous generation. He is a Jewish-American, who has worked hard during his life to achieve his position in life as a well-established, successful, and admired doctor and/or "professor." He refuses to "carry" his children on his back because he believes they should come to their own achievements, as he is a believer in the American "protestant work ethic." He is rational and straight- laced; he is stern and often harsh; and, most importantly, he does not truly understand his son.

-- #X_0# --
Also resident of #Y_2# and a "friend" of #X_1#'s, #X_0# is a fraudulent and questionable character. He claims to be many things and is constantly giving #X_1# psychoanalytical advice. He says he is a psychologist and a poet, and he claims to be a member of #Y_1#, the head of a medical clinic in #Y_0#, the co-inventor of an unsinkable ship, a technical consultant in television, and a widow. His statements are brought into question and although most people seem to distrust him, #X_1# is attracted to him. It is with #X_0# that #X_1# enters into a joint stock market venture, entrusting the old, East-European, Jewish doctor with the last of his money.

-- #X_0# --
The wife of #X_2# #X_4#. #X_0# is separated from her husband. The only view we receive of her is through #X_2#. We are told that she is cold, harsh, and unsympathetic. As the mother of #X_2#'s two boys, she is demanding of #X_4#, constantly asking, for instance, for monetary support. She refuses to grant #X_2# a divorce and has made settlements difficult. She claims that she will not make it "easy" for #X_2# to leave. She is a character that we never read in the flesh, for the only encounters we have with her is through #X_2#'s memory, through Dr. #X_1#'s talks of her, and through the phone conversations she has with her husband.

-- #X_0# --
The fraudulent talent scout from #X_1#'s past. #X_0# showed initial interest in #X_1# as an actor. However, we later find out that he is the "failure" of a powerful family in the industry. He initially is attracted to #X_1# because of his good looks, but later refuses to work with him because of a failed screen test—#X_1#'s faults, such as stuttering, are magnified on the screen. Later, the reader finds out that #X_0# had really been a "pimp" and had been running a prostitution ring, using his position as a "talent scout" as a cover.

-- #X_0# --
The woman with whom #X_3# #X_5# is in love. We never meet #X_0#, she is only alluded to. She is a Christian but is willing to marry #X_3# outside the church after he divorces his wife, however, #X_2# will not grant him a divorce. She is described as small, pretty, and dark; a woman who had worked with him at #Y_0# from which #X_3# was fired. His office relationship with her may have had something to do with his release from employment. Apparently, #X_3# is taken by her and probably truly in love with her. It is mentioned many times that #X_2# has ruined things for the couple; but #X_5# constantly thinks of her and says, toward the end of the book, that he will have to go to #X_0#, on his knees, and ask her to "stand by [him] a while…#X_0#loves me."

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s sister and Dr. #X_1#'s daughter. #X_0#, like #X_3#, also changed her name, in her case to #X_2#. She is a married woman with a degree, a Bachelors of Science, from #Y_0#. Nevertheless, she has aspirations as a painter. Her father will not assist her financially so she can rent a gallery space for an exhibition. Dr. #X_1# does not have faith in her talent; in fact, he does not believe she has any. #X_3# does not seem to have particular faith in her either and he does not seem to care much for the paintings although he attempts to defend her, weakly, in front of his father. #X_3#'s reaction to his sister, however, may have to do with the fact that he is speaking to his father when she comes up in conversation. She is another character that the reader never meets in the flesh.

-- #X_0# --
The blind, old man at the stock exchange who cannot see his numbers and is constantly asking for assistance. #X_0# appears in several chapters as a symbolic figure of "blindness." He asks #X_3# for assistance on his venture to the cigar store and #X_3# accompanies him. Nevertheless, he tells a story of once being yelled at by #X_2# during war that allows #X_3# a "moment," one of those fleeting moments in which he feels at one with the world.

-- #X_0# --
A breakfast companion of Dr. #X_1#. #X_0# is a salesman and a man resented by #X_2# for taking the role of what #X_2# believes to be that of a "buffer." #X_2# resents him because he takes on many of the opinions of his father and because #X_2# believes his father has invited him to breakfast so as not to spend time with his son alone.

The narrator and protagonist of the novel. When A Separate Peace begins, #X_0# is in his early thirties, visiting #Y_0# for the first time in years. He is thoughtful and intelligent, with a competitive nature and a tendency to brood. He develops a love-hate relationship with his best friend, #X_1#, whom he alternately adores and envies. He often seems to want to lose hold of his own identity and live as a part of #X_1#, a tendency suggesting that he is strongly uncomfortable with his own personality. Yet the reader must infer this aspect of #X_0#, like much of his character, from the actions that he recounts rather than from any explicit statements regarding his mindset: #X_0# often proves a reticent and unreliable narrator when it comes to his own emotions.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s classmate and best friend. #X_0# is honest, handsome, self-confident, disarming, extremely likable, and the best athlete in the school; in short, he seems perfect in almost every way. He has a talent for engaging others with his spontaneity and sheer joy of living, and, while he frequently gets into trouble, he has the ability to talk his way out of almost any predicament. According to #X_1#, he is rare among human beings in that he never perceives anyone as an enemy, and never strives to defeat others. #X_0#’s behaviors also suggest that he relishes pure achievement rather than competition. His fatal flaw is that he assumes that everyone is like him—that everyone shares his enthusiastic and good-natured spirit.

-- #X_0# --
A classmate of #X_3# and #X_2#. #X_0# is a mild, gentle boy from #Y_1# who adores nature and engages in peaceful, outdoor-oriented hobbies, like cross-country skiing.

He is the first boy from #X_3#’s class to enlist in the army, but military life proves too much for him, and he suffers hallucinations and a breakdown.

-- #X_0# --
A charismatic class politician with an inclination for orderliness and organization. #X_0# is very straight-laced and conservative. He has complete confidence in his own abilities and has a tendency to carry his ideas through with startling efficiency—at times even ruthlessness.

-- #X_0# --
The manager of the crew team. #X_0# briefly assumes a position of power over #X_1# when #X_1# volunteers to be assistant crew manager. The boys at #Y_0# have never liked #X_0#; thus, he frequently takes out his frustrations on anyone whom he considers his inferior.

#X_0# is the title character and protagonist of the book. A stoic, mysterious man, he says little about himself—no one even knows his last name. He dresses differently and moves differently, with a kind of confidence and power that is immediately noticeable. He is #X_1#'s hero and quickly becomes #X_2# companion. #X_0# is loyal to the very end, never compromising any of the #X_3# or placing them in danger. He is quick to deal with people and situations that are potentially dangerous, and he feels both tenderness and responsibility for the #X_3#. He is both dangerous and the safest man to have around because it is clear that he can handle himself in a fistfight or gunfight, but it is also clear that once tied to someone he will forever be loyal. #X_0# epitomizes for the novel both what it means to be a man and what it means to be a hero.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# immediately latches on to #X_3#, finding him a good friend, companion, and co-worker. #X_3#'s intense love and respect for #X_0# is mirrored by #X_0#'s feelings for #X_3#. The two men are undyingly loyal to one another, and they often work and act in tandem. They even both love the same woman. #X_0# is the leader of the group of farmers, especially when it comes to their problems with #X_1#. #X_3# teaches #X_0# how to be a better man and improves #X_0#'s life in a number of ways, including helping him work the land. #X_0# is an extremely fair man who treats others with respect and consideration. When #X_0# finds out about #X_2#'s feelings for #X_3#, he is not angry; instead, he acknowledges #X_3#'s greatness, and it makes sense to him that she should love #X_3#. #X_0# never has an ill word to say about #X_3# throughout the course of the book, even after #X_3# knocks him unconscious to prevent him from taking the matter with #X_1# and #X_4# into his own hands.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the narrator of the book and allows us to see #X_2# and the rest of the characters and events through the eyes of a boy. He is a boy yearning for action and yearning for someone to revere. His father is his hero, but, when he meets #X_2#, he realizes that #X_2# is the most extraordinary man he has ever known. #X_2# redefines for #X_0# what it means to be a man and a hero, and #X_2# teaches #X_0# many lessons, such as that it does not take a man to engage in a fight. He also teaches #X_0# to accept responsibility for his actions, even if some external force has provoked them. #X_0# looks at #X_2# with wonder and awe throughout the book, and it is easy then for the reader to absorb this outlook. Much of #X_2#'s impact, especially on #X_1#, is lost on #X_0# because he is too young to understand it.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the only significant female character in the book. A good wife, mother, and cook, she also embraces #X_4# wholeheartedly. At first she is concerned about the fact that he seems so dangerous, and later she is concerned about the toll the situation with #X_2# takes on #X_4#. Throughout the book #X_0# falls in love with #X_4#. However, she does not fall out of love with #X_3#; rather, she recognizes that they are both wonderful men and loves them both. She admits to #X_4# that she needs him, and the two have an extremely close bond even though there is never any physical infidelity. While #X_3# and #X_4# are brought close together by the physicality of their work, #X_4# and #X_0# are brought together on an emotional level that reflects each other's insights and perceptions toward the other. #X_0# also appreciates that #X_1# has another role model in his life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the antagonist of the book. He is a pure villain and a problem from the outset, becoming increasingly more and more threatening as the book progresses. He is angry that #X_1# will not sell him his farm and angry that #X_1# has rallied the other farmers against him. When #X_2# comes to town, #X_1# becomes an even more formidable adversary to #X_0#, driving #X_0# to greater and greater lengths in order to triumph. #X_0# resorts to violence and murder and stands in direct contrast as a man to both #X_1# and #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is the one dynamic character in the book—he undergoes almost a complete transformation. Initially one of #X_1#'s men, he begins escalating the situation with #X_2#. After #X_2# beats him up #X_2# makes a comment about #X_0#'s goodness but of his immaturity as well. When #X_0#offers to take #X_2#'s place at the #X_3#'s, we witness a man growing up and coming full circle. #X_0#is a character that is changed dynamically because of #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# brings #X_0# into town after it is clear that #X_3# and #X_2# will not back down. #X_0#does not have much dimension as a character and serves only to provide deadly threat and the final confrontation with #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
A thirty-four-year-old truck driver from #Y_0#. #X_0# married his wife, #X_1#, when they were both eighteen. #X_0# adores #X_1# but feels he no longer knows her.

Because of an accident that injured his left hip and leg, #X_0# is unable to drive his rig and sits at home with too much time on his hands. A pot-smoker and craft-maker, #X_0# spends more time thinking and worrying than he does taking concrete steps to improve his life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s wife. At thirty-four, #X_0# #X_0# is restless, unhappy, and annoyed by #X_2#’s constant presence.

She works on strengthening her body and mind, taking weightlifting classes and enrolling in night school. #X_0# #X_0# is a smart, fiery woman, but she struggles to understand her own feelings and express herself.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s mother. A dumpy, unattractive woman who works in an upholstery shop, #X_0# keeps tabs on the cleanliness of her daughter’s house. She was widowed when #X_2# was ten, and holds a special place in her heart for #Y_0#, the battleground where she and her late husband took their honeymoon. #X_0# is a nag and constant critic. She makes nasty remarks about #X_1#’s leisure pursuits and tells a story meant to make #X_2# feel responsible for #X_4#’s death. Still, she loves her daughter and son-in-law and worries about the changes she sees in them. It upsets her to see #X_2# smoking and studying. She fears that her daughter will addle her brains if she reads and thinks too much. #X_1#’s inactivity and aimlessness also bothers her. She would like it best if #X_2# and #X_1# stuck to their traditional, narrowly defined gender roles.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s and #X_2#’s son. At four months and three days old, #X_0# died of SIDS at the drive-in while his parents watched Dr. Strangelove. #X_1# and #X_2# think of him often, but they don’t talk about him. He is a vague but painful memory that they can refer to only occasionally and obliquely. His death has left a void in their lives.

-- #X_0# --
The local kid who sells marijuana to #X_1#. The son of a thirty-six-year-old doctor who was two classes ahead of #X_1# in school, #X_0# is the same age that #X_2# would have been had he lived. #X_1# is interested in this link between #X_0# and #X_2# and tries to make conversation with the young drug dealer. #X_0# sees #X_1# only as a source of income and brushes off his attempts at friendliness.

-- #X_0# --
A thirty-six year old pathetic newspaper reporter and the protagonist for the novel. #X_0# is a failure at life, and, the narrator tells, a failure of physical appearance. He is extremely large and clumsy, with a most prominent shelf under his chin. #X_0# is lonely and consigned to seeing himself as a failure, and is therefore vulnerable to the hurt of a cruel lover. His submissive kindness does help him make friends and he is a loving father. He is deathly afraid of water and car wrecks. The prodigy of a long line of wild, dimwitted murderers, #X_0# struggles with segregating himself from the pain of his familial and personal past.

#X_0# is #X_1#'s oldest daughter and the one more prone to temper-tantrums and emotional stress. #X_0# is deathly afraid of any resemblance of a white dog. Although she looks like #X_1# in size and shape, she is not the object of ridicule and scorn among her peers. She has a penchant for carpentry.         #X_0# is the younger of #X_1#'s daughters, she is more easy-going in manner. Like #X_0#, she loves her father dearly. She and #X_0# play the role of the "maids in the meadow" in #X_1#'s life.

Politically, he falls on the opposite end of the spectrum from #X_1#, worshipping oil and the age of technology in general. He is cantankerous and crusty.

He prides himself on his observance of the five points of chivalry in every aspect of his life. #X_0# is a pinnacle of humility, piety, integrity, loyalty, and honesty. His only flaw proves to be that he loves his own life so much that he will lie in order to protect himself. #X_0# leaves #Y_0# penitent and changed.

-- #X_0# --
A mysterious visitor to Camelot. The #X_0#’s huge stature, wild appearance, and green complexion set him apart from the beardless knights and beautiful ladies of #X_2#’s Camelot. He is an ambiguous figure: he says that he comes in friendship, not wanting to fight, but the friendly game he proposes is quite deadly. He attaches great importance to verbal contracts, expecting Sir #X_4# to go to great lengths to hold up his end of their bargain. The #X_0# shows himself to be a supernatural being when he picks up his own severed head and rides out of #X_2#’s court, still speaking. At the same time, he seems to symbolize the natural world, in that he is killed and reborn as part of a cycle. At the poem’s end, we discover that the #X_0# is also #X_3#, #X_4#’s host, and one of #X_5# minions.

-- #X_0# --
The sturdy, good-natured lord of the castle where #X_3# spends Christmas. We only learn #X_0#’s name at the end of Sir #X_3# and #X_5#. The poem associates #X_0# with the natural world—his beard resembles a beaver, his face a fire—but also with the courtly behavior of an aristocratic host. Boisterous, powerful, brave, and generous, Lord #X_0# provides an interesting foil to King #X_2#. At the end of the poem we learn that #X_0# and #X_5# are the same person, magically enchanted by #X_4# for her own designs.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# attempts to seduce #X_2# on a daily basis during his stay at the castle. Though the poem presents her to the reader as no more than a beautiful young woman, #X_0# is an amazingly clever debater and an astute reader of #X_2#’s responses as she argues her way through three attempted seductions. Flirtatious and intelligent, #X_0# ultimately turns out to be another pawn in #X_3# plot.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_1#ian tradition typically portrays #X_0# as a powerful sorceress, trained by #X_2#, as well as the half sister of King #X_1#. Not until the last one hundred lines do we discover that the old woman at the cast#X_0# is #X_0#and that she has control#X_0#d the poem’s entire action from beginning to end. As she often does in #X_1#ian literature, #X_0# appears as an enemy of Camelot, one who aims to cause as much troub#X_0# for her half brother and his followers as she can.

-- #X_0# --
The king of #X_1#. In Sir #X_2# and the Green Knight, #X_0# is young and beardless, and his court is in its golden age. #X_0#’s refusal to eat until he hears a fantastic tale shows the petulance of youth, as does #X_0#’s initial stunned response to #X_3# challenge. However, like a good king, #X_0# soon steps forward to take on the challenge. At the story’s end, #X_0# joins his nephew in wearing a green girdle on his arm, showing that #X_2#’s trial has taught him about his own fallibility.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s wife. The beautiful young #X_0# of Sir #X_2# and #X_3# seems to have little in common with the one of later #X_1#ian legend. She sits next to #X_2# at the New Year’s feast and remains a silent, objectified presence in the midst of the knights of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
Somewhat slow-witted and of fiery temper. #X_0#is largely a comic figure who agrees to play the role of the Characters' author and realizing their drama.

Timid and wretched, the fourteen-year-old #X_0# has been driven mute in his humiliation at having to enter the new household on the Father's charity.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s author and a minor character. #X_0# himself was a prisoner of war during the firebombing of #Y_0#, and he periodically inserts himself in the narrative, as when he becomes the incontinent soldier in the latrine in the German prison camp. This authorial presence reappears throughout the novel, particularly in the refrain “So it goes” that follows each mention of death. #X_0#’s commentary as a character and an author enables a more factual interpretation of a story that seems almost preternaturally fictional and adds support to the idea that such fantastical elements may be the reality of a traumatized mind.

-- #X_0# --
A wartime pal of #X_3#. #X_0# appears when #X_3# visits him and his wife in #Y_0# while trying to do research and collect remembrances for his #X_1# book. Like his wife, #X_2#, and #X_3# himself, #X_0#, a nonfictional character, helps ground Slaughterhouse-Five in reality. #X_3# actually has this other survivor of the firebombing contribute to the research and recollection process involved in creating the book, which allows us to take the novelistic details as fact and appreciate the thoughtful manner in which they are presented.

-- #X_0# --
Bernhard #X_0#’s wife. #X_0# gets upset with #X_2# because she believes that he will glorify war in his novel; #X_2#, however, promises not to do so. Slaughterhouse-Five is a condemnation of war, and #X_2#’s decision to dedicate the novel in part to #X_0# suggests how deeply he agrees with her that the ugly truth about war must be told.

-- #X_0# --
The nonfictional taxi driver who takes #X_2# and #X_1# back to their #Y_0# slaughterhouse. #X_0# later sends #X_1# a Christmas card bearing tidings of peace, and #X_2# dedicates the novel in part to #X_0#—two simple gestures of sympathy that stand out amid the novel’s pervasive cruelty and violence.

-- #X_0# --
A stupid, cruel soldier taken prisoner by the Germans along with #X_1#. Unlike #X_1#, who is totally out of place in the war, #X_0# is a deluded glory-seeker who fancies himself part of #Y_0# and saves #X_1#’s life out of a desire to be heroic.

-- #X_0# --
An army colonel in the German rail yard who has lost his mind. #X_0# asks if #X_1# belongs to his regiment when, in fact, all his men are dead. He invites everyone to visit him in #Y_0#, but his arbitrary death shows how the war makes such gestures both poignant and pointless.

-- #X_0# --
Another POW and the man responsible for #X_1#’s death. #X_0#, a revenge-loving ruffian with criminal tendencies, arranges for #X_1#’s assassination to avenge #X_2# death. #X_0#’s determination to kill #X_1# does not create a conflict between the two characters, however; because #X_1# has accepted the #X_3#’ conception of nonlinear time, he is unconcerned by his death.

-- #X_0# --
Another survivor of #Y_0#’s incineration. Following the firebombing, #X_0# is sentenced to die by firing squad for plundering a teapot from the wreckage. His death is anticlimactic, since #X_1# does not view it with any sense of pathos, but rather as an inevitability.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s pleasant, fat wife who loves him dearly. #X_0# and #X_2# share a well-appointed home and have two children together, but #X_2# consistently distances himself from his family.

-- #X_0# --
Aliens shaped like toilet plungers, each with one hand containing an eye in its palm. The #X_0#’ philosophies of time and death influence the narrative style of the novel. They perceive time as an assemblage of moments existing simultaneously rather than as a linear progression, and the episodic nature of Slaughterhouse-Five reflects this notion of time. Their acceptance of death, which #X_1# embraces, leads the narrator to remark simply “So it goes” at each mention of death.

-- #X_0# --
A war veteran who occupies the bed near #X_1# in the mental ward of a veterans’ hospital. Like #X_1#, #X_0# is suffering from the aftereffects of war, and he finds escape—and helps #X_1# find escape—in the science-fiction novels of #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A bitter, unappreciated author of several cleverly ironic science-fiction novels that have a great influence on #X_1#. #X_0#, who appears in many of #X_2#’s works, functions as #X_2#’s alter ego.

-- #X_0# --
An American who has become a Nazi. #X_2# speaks to the prisoners in the slaughterhouse and tries to recruit them for “#Y_0#,” a German army unit that he is forming to fight the Russians. #X_2# represents all that is wrong with war; he desires to use people for perverse ideological ends.

-- #X_0# --
A young German guard at the slaughterhouse. #X_0# gets his first glimpse of a naked woman along with #X_1#. Their shared intrigue and interest in the naked female body unites these two men from different sides, reflecting how fundamentally human feelings—such as lust—can trump differences of political ideology.

-- #X_0# --
A nubile young actress who is kidnapped by the Tralfamadorians to be #X_1#’s mate inside the zoo. #X_1# wins #X_0#’s trust and love, and fathers a child by her in #Y_1#. But #X_1# likely is delusional about his experiences with #X_0#, whose presence may have been imaginatively triggered by a visit to an adult bookstore in #Y_0#, where he sees her videos and a headline claiming to reveal her fate.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s daughter, newly married at the age of twenty-one, who is faced with the sudden death of her mother and the apparent mental breakdown of her father. #X_0# represents the follow-up generation to the one ravaged by World War II. While #X_1#’s ability to function in life and be successful in a career paves the way for #X_0#’s development, his war trauma and delusions constantly frustrate her.

-- #X_0# --
A #Y_1# history professor and the official #Y_2# historian who is laid up by a skiing accident in the same #Y_3# hospital as #X_2# after his plane crash. #X_0#’s reluctance to believe that #X_2# was present during the #Y_0# raid embodies the bureaucratic attitude that seeks to glorify the war and its heroes instead of realistically portraying war’s destructiveness and its haphazard selection of survivors.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s young trophy wife and research assistant. #X_0# is frightened of #X_2#, but she lies silent in the next bed as a symbol of the scope of powerlessness and lack of free will.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s son, who is a failure and a delinquent at school, though he cleans up his life enough to become a Green Beret in the #Y_0# War. #X_0#’s presence in the story during #X_1#’s later life helps illustrate the pervasiveness of #X_1#’s war trauma, especially his inability to communicate and relate to his own son. #X_0#’s successful self-reformation from delinquency to discipline (in #Y_0#) seems to indicate #X_2#’s acceptance of the inevitability of war.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is described as a woman “trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops” (she once hung a grisly crucifix in #X_0# room but never joined a church because she couldn’t settle on a denomination). She visits #X_1# in the mental hospital, and her presence embarrasses him because he feels like an ungrateful son for being indifferent to life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# throws young #X_1# into the #Y_0# pool to teach him how to swim. #X_1# prefers the bottom of the pool, but he is rescued unwillingly from drowning after he loses consciousness. This incident initiates the novel’s theme of the illusory nature of free will.

-- #X_0# --
The first postindependence Prime Minister of #Y_0#, and, with the exception of one five-year term, the only one. The #Y_0# airport is named for #X_0#. He is the head of an extremely corrupt government, and his sons are poised to take his place once he dies. This, along with the facts that #Y_0# has a standing army with nothing to do and that the government controls the media, leads #X_1# to worry about the long-term viability of democracy on the island.

-- #X_0# --
An imposing figure in the life of the young #X_2#. #X_0# head librarian holds a culturally prestigious post, though a diminished one now. At one time, she worked in the beautiful old library in the central part of town. After an earthquake destroyed the library, the collection moved to “temporary” quarters—for over ten years. #X_0# head librarian’s struggles to raise money for a new library, and her makeshift bookroom above a dry goods store, render her a sad figure of the decline of the already meager cultural institutions on #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A twenty-six-year-old woman recruited by #Y_2# in #Y_1# to run the girl’s school in #Y_0#. #X_0# headmistress often rebuked the girls by telling them to stop behaving “as if they were monkeys just out of the trees.” Her thoughtless racism is emblematic of the callousness of colonial rule and of the passivity of the #Y_0#ns when faced with it.

-- #X_0# --
The author and narrator of A Small Place. #X_0# makes use of personal experience and history in the essay, and the entire work is permeated with her anger and intelligence. #X_0# emerges as a character both as a young girl, desperate for knowledge and a wider world, and as an adult, looking at her birthplace with a ruthlessly penetrating eye.

-- #X_0# --
The author’s mother. #X_0# mother appears briefly in an anecdote that #X_1# tells about her political activity. Her brash opinions and loud mouth earn her a reputation as a troublemaker, and the Minister of Culture is not pleased to find her posting signs for the opposition party in front of his house. When he tries to snub her, #X_0# mother implies that he is a crook and that she knows all about it; the Minister retreats. Even in this brief scene, #X_0# admiration for and ambivalence toward her formidable mother are clear.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# man, unnamed by #X_2#, who supplants #X_1# for one term. This #X_0# Minister campaigns as an enlightened democrat and promises to fight corruption. #X_0#re are stories of dishonesty in his own past, including one that he destroyed the accounting books of one of his employers to hide his embezzlement. #X_0# great optimism that greets his election is soon quenched by the incompetence of his administration, and he is jailed after losing the next election.

-- #X_0# --
The younger sister of the future queen of #Y_1#, #X_2#. #X_0# makes a state visit to #Y_0# when #X_3# is a child. The entire island is spruced up for her arrival, and the princess is greeted by crowds who regard the visit as one of the great events in #Y_0#’s history. Years later, #X_3# learns that, far from being motivated by any particular interest in #Y_0# or the #Y_0#ns, #X_0# had simply been trying to escape a sticky personal situation back in #Y_1#—she had fallen in love with a married man.

-- #X_0# --
Foreigners who have moved to #Y_0# to make their fortunes in business speculation. To the #Y_0#ns, the #X_0# are involved in most of the corruption on the island. #X_1# points out that they have connections high in the government and that they have become fabulously wealthy by renting properties to the government at exorbitant prices. She also implies that the #X_0# may be involved in politically and economically motivated violence, such as the strange deaths-by-electrocution that befall certain officials.

-- #X_0# --
A wealthy woman #X_2# speaks to regarding the rebuilding effort for the library. This unnamed woman is well-known for her dislike of the Antiguans in any role except that of a servant. She encourages “her girls” (employees) to use the library and wants to rebuild it just as it was before the earthquake. #X_2# sees her as motivated by nostalgia for the days of colonial rule and resents the woman’s smirking at the corruption of the post-independence government, though she also resents the accuracy of the charge.

-- #X_0# --
The personified reader whom #X_1# addresses throughout the essay. Especially in the first section, “you,” the reader, is characterized as a basically ordinary, middle-class American or European, mostly ignorant of #Y_0#’s history and of the lives of its inhabitants. #X_0# becomes the main focus of #X_1#’s attack on what she sees as the moral ugliness of tourism.

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s protagonist. #X_0# is the thirty-one-year-old editor of the local paper, #Y_0#. He is a World War II veteran, and a gunshot in the war has left him with an amputated left arm. As a young boy, #X_0# had a deep friendship with a local Japanese-American girl, #X_1# Imada. But #X_1# eventually called an abrupt end to the relationship and married #X_3#, leaving #X_0# bitter and resentful.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#’s wife, whose maiden name is #X_0# Imada. #X_0# and #X_3# became friends as small children, and by the time they entered their adolescence, #X_3# had fallen in love with her. #X_0#, however, always experienced doubt regarding the nature of her feelings for #X_3#. Throughout her life, #X_0# is torn between her Japanese culture and family background and her desire for a world without societal pressures and prejudices.

-- #X_0# --
The Japanese-American fisherman who stands trial for the alleged murder of #X_1#. When #X_0# was a boy, his family worked as sharecroppers on the strawberry farm owned by #X_1#, Sr. Like his father, #X_3#, #X_0# is a master at kendo, the Japanese art of stick fighting. #X_0# considers himself a murderer because he killed enemy soldiers in World War II, in which he fought for #Y_0#. Since the war, #X_0# has been consumed with his dream to repurchase his family’s land.

-- #X_0# --
The local fisherman who dies mysteriously on the night of September 15, 1954. The son of #X_2# and #X_0# Sr., #X_0# was a high school classmate of #X_5#, #X_4#, and #X_3#’s and was particularly good friends with #X_5#. After fighting in World War II, however, #X_0# struggled with his prejudices toward people of Japanese descent. A physically robust, quiet man, he was greatly respected and admired by residents of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father. #X_0# founded and edited #Y_1#, the most prominent newspaper on the island. #X_0# frequently—and courageously—used the editorial column in his newspaper as a forum to condemn the racism directed at #Y_0# Japanese-American residents during World War II. Though his editorials often provoked hostility from much of the community, #X_0# maintained a strong heart and firmly believed that his perspective was the correct one.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s mother. Now a widow, #X_0# remains committed to the principles of tolerance and honesty her husband demonstrated. She doubts that #X_3#’s trial is fair. Concerned about #X_2#’s solitary and seemingly joyless life, #X_0# urges her son to get over his emotional issues and fall in love again.

-- #X_0# --
The local sheriff. #X_0# initially believes that #X_1#’s death is an accident, but he begins to suspect #X_2# of murder after hearing the coroner’s offhand comment that #X_1#’s head wound resembles wounds inflicted by Japanese soldiers skilled in the martial art of kendo. His willingness to make such a leap of logic epitomizes the anti-Japanese sentiment prevalent on #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# young and relatively inexperienced deputy.

-- #X_0# --
The #Y_0# coroner and a World War II veteran. #X_0# is shattered by his experience as a wartime doctor and feels like a shell of his former self. He envies #X_1# Heine’s strength and vitality even as he examines #X_1#’s corpse.

-- #X_0# --
The judge presiding over #X_1#’s murder trial. Although he lets on to be sleepy and distracted, #X_0# #X_0# is keenly aware of everything that takes place in his courtroom. He understands the racially charged nature of #X_1#’s trial and does all he can to diminish the role that racism plays in the proceedings.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s morally upright defense attorney. #X_0# is in his late seventies, and his health is failing. Though he is blind in one eye, his good eye exudes a sharp, penetrating intelligence.

-- #X_0# --
The prosecuting attorney in #X_2#’s trial. #X_0# charges #X_2# with first-degree murder and is rabidly seeking the death penalty. He subtly appeals to the jury’s racism during the trial.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# #X_0#’s beautiful, blond widow. When she was seventeen, #X_0# #X_0# began to enjoy and relish her sexuality and physical attractiveness, using them to pursue #X_1# when she was twenty. Though #X_0# #X_0# feels that #X_1# was a hardworking, steady husband and a good lover, she began to worry when she realized that their sex life constituted the core of their marriage.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0#’s father, who owned the strawberry farm on which the young #X_2#’s family lived and worked as sharecroppers.

-- #X_0# --
Carl #X_0# Sr.’s rabidly racist wife. #X_0# was furious when her husband agreed to sell seven acres of his strawberry farm to #X_4#, #X_2#’s father. Immediately after her husband’s death, #X_0# sold his land to a white farmer, #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
A farmer and landowner in #Y_0#. After #X_2# died, #X_3# sold his strawberry farm to #X_0#, including the seven acres that #X_4# had contracted to buy from her husband. When #X_0# suffers a stroke in June 1954, he puts his farm up for sale, and #X_1# quickly snatches it up.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s mother. While her daughters were growing up, #X_0# was wary of hakujin, the word she used to refer to white Americans. She urged her young daughters to follow their Japanese cultural traditions and roles, and did not want to see them act like white Americans.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s father.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s teacher. When #X_1# was thirteen, her parents sent her to #X_0#for training in social graces. #X_0#told #X_1# to avoid white men and their bizarre fetishes for Japanese girls and advised #X_1# to marry a good Japanese man. She thus represents the old school of Japanese values.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father. When #X_2# was eight years old, #X_0# began training him in the Japanese martial art of kendo, or stick fighting, and emphasized the discipline and self-restraint of the art. Like Mrs. #X_3#, #X_0# embodies traditional Japanese values.

-- #X_0# --
A local boat builder and member of the jury in #X_1#’s trial. #X_0# #X_0# does not believe the evidence proves #X_1#’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and he refuses to convict the fisherman of murder until the other jurors effectively convince him of #X_1#’s guilt.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# is #X_2#'s best friend, and at the beginning of the book he is much more of a thinker than his friend, who favors action. But as the story unfolds #X_3# finds that, much like Charles #X_0#, he is capable of quick and decisive action once he has made a critical decision. He saves #X_2# several times and saves his father another time because, although he is only a thirteen year old boy, he is certain of his knowledge and believes that he is doing the right thing. #X_3# cares deeply about doing what is right, and, unlike #X_2#, he favors inaction when the alternative is harmful or destructive. #X_3# is selfless, and he runs tremendous risks to save #X_2# even when #X_2# himself does not necessarily want to be saved.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# is in turmoil throughout the course of the book. He wants to help #X_3# and Mr. #X_1# fight the carnival but at the same time he is filled with desire to ride the carousel and instantly grow up. #X_2# is fiercely independent and afraid of nothing, and with the carnival these traits threaten to get him into a situation that as a thirteen year old he will not be able to get out of. Fortunately, he has #X_3# and Mr. #X_1# to help him. #X_2# is not sure of what he wants, and he is the type who tries thinks if he thinks he might like them. But the carousel is not the sort of thing that one can just try and then walk away from. #X_2# knows this but refuses to admit it because he is so intent on going for a ride.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#finds himself throughout the course of the novel. He has to protect #X_3# and #X_2#, and in the process he is transformed. Mr. #X_0# starts out as an old man who vividly remembers his times as a youth but is sure that his days of action are over. But he slowly learns that there is more action in him then he thought, and it also becomes apparent that he is a man with cool nerves and much inner strength. He is the only one who truly sees the carnival for the mockery that it is, and this allows him to laugh at it. He destroys the carnival by laughing at it, and he laughs with such certainty because he is completely comfortable with who he is.

-- #X_0# --
The major evil character in the book, #X_0# is the Illustrated Man. He is covered in tattoos and each tattoo allows him to exert some power over the figure that is represented. He feeds on pain and destruction and wants nothing less. #X_0# is afraid of nothing except the good that #X_1# uses to defeat him. He is tremendously strong and intimidates people, inspiring fear when he wishes to. The freaks at the carnival are completely within his power, and he uses both manipulation and force to bend people to his will.

-- #X_0# --
Along with #X_0# #X_1#, #X_0# is in charge of the carnival. He is pure evil, and he pretends to be Miss #X_2#'s nephew #X_4# in order to get her to ride on the carousel. #X_0# also tries to get #X_3# to ride on the merry-go-round, and if not for #X_5# he would have succeeded. Although he is dangerous and cunning, #X_0# is a threatening possibility for most of the book since he is too old to do anything after #X_5# messes up his carousel ride.

-- #X_0# --
A woman who is not happy with her life, #X_0# thinks that she can find happiness on the merry-go-round. She is obsessed with the idea of the carousel and tries to get #X_2# and #X_1# into trouble so that they will not stop her from using it, even though the boys saved her from #Y_0#. The carousel does not save her but rather takes everything from her and turns her into the broken little girl that the boys come across.

-- #X_0# --
Though the #X_0# is blind, she feels and hears things that no one else feels or hears. She is the lookout for Mr. #X_3# and the carnival. The #X_0# is evil and greedy, and #X_4# uses those traits against her when he destroys her balloon. She is also fearsome, but only if her powers are believed in, and #X_2# destroys her with a laugh.

-- #X_0# --
In the first scene #X_0#warns #X_2# and #X_1# of the storm that is coming. It turns out that he is the first casualty of the carnival because he cannot resist the beauty of the ice sculpture in the store. Once he is turned into the Dwarf, his presence is a constant reminder of the evil of the carnival and the horrific damage that is inflicted upon its victims.

-- #X_0# --
In the one scene where #X_1# talks to his #X_0# much of her character comes through. She is a single #X_0#. #X_0# father beat her and has been gone for many years, but she is still fragile. She lost her other two children and now has only #X_1#. She tries to protect him but knows that he will leave her someday.

-- #X_0# --
A very minor character in the book, present mostly in #X_0# thoughts, his #X_0# is truly happy and content in her life. #X_2# and Mr. #X_1# deliberately protect her from the carnival by not telling her what is happening.

-- #X_0# --
The barber, #X_0# informs #X_2# and #X_1# that he smells cotton candy. He realizes that a carnival is coming to town and he becomes sentimental. #X_0# was likely one of the first casualties of the carnival because the next night a sign in his shop says he is closed due to illness.

-- #X_0# --
The owner of #Y_0#, #X_0# sees #X_2# and #X_1# in the beginning of the book and pops up throughout the story. His significance is solely due to the fact that he is the proprietor of the store.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the name of Miss #X_2#'s real nephew who never appears in the book. When #X_4# and #X_3# first see Miss #X_2# at the carnival she is looking for him, and later Mr. #X_1# pretends to be him.

-- #X_0# --
Historically, #X_0#(742?-814), was king of the Franks and a committed, militant Christian. A loyal ally of the pope and a great conqueror, he forced conversions as he expanded the boundaries of his empire outward from his central territory, straddling present-day #Y_0# and #Y_1#. In 800 he was crowned emperor by the pope, legitimizing his rule over the former Roman empire in western Europe. After his death, he became legendary; it is this legendary #X_0#, the most perfect Christian king, symbol of the spirit of the Crusades, and favorite of heaven, who is presented in The Song of #X_3# as leader of the Frankish troops and #X_3#'s uncle and avenger. His name means literally, "#X_2#."

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is only mentioned in passing in the historical records, as the prefect of the Breton Marches, among those who fell at #Y_1#. In The Song of #X_0#, however, he is the hero. He is one of the twelve peers of #Y_0#, #X_1#'s nephew and favorite, a skillful and extremely bold warrior and understands the Frankish campaign in #Y_2# as a crusade, allowing no compromise with the Saracens. His sometimes showy boldness and his great popularity among the Franks and success on the battlefield arouse the venomous resentment of his stepfather, #X_2#, who arranges with the Saracens the ambush at #Y_1#. He dies a martyr's death at #Y_1# and is directly taken up to Paradise by saints and angels. The rest of the poem recounts how #X_1# avenges his death.

-- #X_0# --
A gallant warrior, one of the twelve peers of #Y_0#, and #X_2#'s best friend, #X_0# is the protagonist's foil, setting off #X_2#'s daring with his own prudence: "#X_2# is bold, #X_0# is wise, and both of them are marvelously brave" (87.1093-1094). At #Y_1#, #X_0# sees how the Franks will be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of the Saracens and urges #X_2# to blow his oliphant and call back to #X_1# for aid. #X_2# is too proud to do so, angering #X_0#, but the two end their quarrel before dying, remaining the greatest and most tender of companions. #X_0#, along with #X_2# and #X_3#, is taken back to #Y_0# for burial by #X_1#'s men.

-- #X_0# --
The archbishop #X_0#, who fights and dies alongside #X_3# at #Y_1#, represents Christendom's turn towards militant activity at the time of the Crusades. The way he battles against the pagans reflects the views put forth in Pope #X_4#'s famous speech at the Council of Clermont in 1095, the direct inspiration for the First Crusade. He is a stout and valiant warrior—"[n]o tonsured priest who ever sang a mass/performed such feats of prowess with his body" (121.1606-1607). He is the last to die besides #X_3#; when he sees #X_3# faint, #X_0# tenderly sets out for a stream to fetch some water for his dear comrade, but, mortally wounded, he falls down dead before reaching the water. Along with #X_2# and #X_3#, he is taken by #X_1#'s men back to #Y_0# for burial.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a well-respected Frankish baron and #X_3#'s stepfather. He resents his stepson's boastfulness and great popularity among the Franks and success on the battlefield. When #X_3# nominates him as messenger to the Saracens, #X_0# is so deeply offended that he vows vengeance. This vengeance becomes treachery as #X_0# plots with the pagan #X_1# the ambush at Roncesvals. At the end, justice is served when #X_0#'s comrade #X_2# is defeated in a trial-by-combat, showing that #X_0# is a traitor in the eyes of God. Thus #X_0# is torn limb from limb by four fiery horses.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the single dissenting voice at the council of barons convened to judge #X_2#. While the others urge that #X_2# be acquitted and allowed to continue serving #X_1#, #X_0# argues that, because #X_5# should have been immune from personal attacks while he was in #X_1#'s service, #X_2#'s action was not private vengeance but a betrayal of the emperor. #X_2#'s friend #X_4# then challenges him to trial-by-combat. #X_4# is the mightier warrior, but #X_3# intervenes to allow #X_0# victory. From this proof of #X_3#'s judgment of the matter, the Franks realize that #X_2# is the basest traitor and kill him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s closest companion and a mighty and eloquent Frankish baron, #X_0# defends #X_2# at his trial. He at first convinces #X_1#'s council of barons to let #X_2# live, but he is challenged by #X_3#, and killed by the weaker man in trial-by-combat, thus showing with whom God's favor lies. #X_0#'s thirty kinsmen who, according to the protocol of such things, volunteer to be hostages to ensure that #X_0# will show up at the appointed time and place and conduct himself properly during the battle are rather gratuitously hung at the end of the poem.

-- #X_0# --
The chronicles say nothing about Duke #X_0# other than that he was a Gascon lord who paid homage to #X_2#, but he became known as a wise advisor in medieval legends. He is prudent and loyal, but his prudence sometimes leads him astray, as when he urges moderation and mercy toward #X_3#. He is less under the sway of his passions than #X_2# or any of the rest of #X_2#'s barons; when the Franks weep and faint upon seeing the carnage at #Y_0#, "#X_0# profoundly pities all of them" (177.2417). He fights nobly in the battle against #X_1#'s army.

-- #X_0# --
The Danish count #X_0# is one of Charlemagne's fiercest and most reliable vassals.

-- #X_0# --
Count #X_0# of #Y_0# is among the twelve barons #X_1# picks for his rear guard. #X_0# is to lead a thousand Franks in scouting around the hilltops and ravines around the pass. He is the third to last to perish at #Y_1#, just before #X_2# and #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
Some time earlier on in #X_1#'s Spanish campaign than the point at which The Song of #X_4# begins, #X_3# had sent an embassy of pagans carrying olive branches over to #X_1# with a peace offer. #X_1# then sent two of his counts, #X_0#, over to the pagans to negotiate and the pagans chopped off their heads. #X_4# reminds the king of this incident when urging him not to pay any attention to #X_3#'s later offer of peace; #X_2# too remembers the two ill-fated messengers when he takes such offense at #X_4# nominating him as an envoy.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# the Beautiful is #X_1#'s sister and #X_2#'s betrothed. She dies of grief the moment she hears of #X_2#'s death.

-- #X_0# --
At the beginning of #X_1#'s campaign in #Y_2#, #X_2# sends for help from #X_0#, the emir of #Y_0# and the noblest that #Y_1# has to offer. Years later, #X_0#finally arrives with an enormous army and sets out to give #X_1# battle. #X_1# and he are evenly matched as far as skill and strength go, but, because of a light touch of angelic intervention, #X_1# is able to kill #X_0#, thus avenging #X_3# and conquering #Y_2# at a stroke.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the pagan king of #Y_1#, the last Spanish city to hold out against the Frankish army. His vassal #X_2# plans with #X_4# the ambush at Roncesvals and death of #X_5#. While #X_5# does die that day, he brings a handsome price beforehand, chopping off #X_0#'s right hand. Badly weakened by this wound, #X_0# dies of grief when he hears of #X_1#'s defeat. #X_0#'s queen, #X_3#, is later taken to #Y_0# and converts to Christianity.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s queen #X_0# falls into a deep despair and feels utterly disgraced after her husband's defeat by the Franks. She begins to curse the Saracen gods for not having helped #X_3# and his men on the battlefield and loses faith in #Y_1#. When the Franks take #X_4#, #X_1# decides to bring her back to #Y_0# to convert her to Christianity, which she does by true conviction. She is baptized #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The shrewd pagan #X_0# is one of #X_4#'s most useful vassals. He suggests that they offer treasure, hostages, and a deceitful promise to #X_1# that #X_4# will come to #Y_0# and convert to Christianity to save their honor and lands from the great #X_2#ish army. #X_4# picks him to deliver the peace offer to the #X_2#s. He and the #X_2# #X_3# then plot together the ambush at #Y_1# and death of #X_5#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_2#'s fiery nephew and leads the #Y_1# ambush squad along with a dozen Muslim lords, paralleling the leadership of the Frankish rear guard by #X_1#'s nephew #X_3# and the twelve peers. Fittingly, he is killed by #X_3# at #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
One of the twelve Saracen lords picked to battle the twelve Frankish peers at #Y_0#, #X_0# is #X_1#'s brother. His forehead, we are told, is "a half-foot wide" (94.1218). He is soon killed by #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
King #X_0# from #Y_0# is an evil magician and one of the twelve Saracen lords picked to battle the twelve Frankish peers at #Y_1#. He is soon killed by #X_2#. The implication that this expert in black magic is the Islamic equivalent of the archbishop is typical of the way that Muslims are depicted in The Song of Roland.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# of #Y_1# is "loved by all the ladies, he's so handsome; / not one can look his way without a glow, / nor, looking at him, keep herself from giggling" (77.957-959). He is one of the twelve Saracen lords picked to battle the twelve Frankish peers at #Y_0#. There he gives #X_1# a good blow, but God protects #X_1# from being wounded by it.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s only son, #X_0# the Blond, is killed at #Y_0#; his head is chopped off by #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the novel, also known as Macon #X_0# III. Born into a sheltered, privileged life, #X_0# grows up to be an egotistical young man. He lacks compassion, wallows in self-pity, and alienates himself from the African-American community. As his nickname suggests, #X_0# literally feeds off of what others produce. But his eventual discovery of his family history gives his life purpose. Although he remains flawed, this newfound purpose makes him compassionate and caring.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# younger sister. Born without a navel, #X_0# is physically and psychologically unlike the novel’s other characters. She is a fearless mother who is selflessly devoted to others. #X_0# is responsible for #X_3#’s safe birth and continues to protect him for years afterward. She also takes care of her daughter, #X_4#, and granddaughter, #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#’s father and #X_5#’s husband, also known as #X_0# #X_1# II. Traumatized by seeing his father murdered during a skirmish over the family farm, #X_0# has developed an obsession with becoming wealthy. In the process, he has become an emotionally dead slumlord. His stony heart softens only when he reminisces about his childhood. #X_0#’s stories about his childhood help fuel #X_4#’s investigation into the history of the #X_1# family.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s best friend. Having grown up in poverty after his father was killed in a factory accident, #X_0# harbors a lifelong hatred for white people, whom he sees as responsible for all evil in the world. #X_3# points out that while #X_0#’s rage is justifiable, his murders of white people neither combat racism nor help the African-American community.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#’s granddaughter and #X_3#’s lover. #X_2# devotes herself to #X_3#, even though he loses interest and frequently rejects her. Like her biblical namesake—a servant who, after bearing #X_1#’s son is thrown out of the house by his barren wife, #X_5#—#X_2# is used and abandoned. Her plight demonstrates a central theme in Song of Solomon: the inevitable abandonment of women who love men too much.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# Jr.’s father and #X_5#’s grandfather, #X_0# is also known as #X_3#. #X_0# was abandoned in infancy when his father, #X_7#, flew back to Africa and his mother, #X_6#, went insane. #X_0# was raised by an #X_0#ndian woman, #X_2#. The mysterious legend of his identity motivates #X_5#’s search for self-understanding.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# wife and the mother of #X_3#, First Corinthians, and #X_1#. After growing up in a wealthy home, #X_0# feels unloved by everyone except her deceased father, Dr. #X_0#. Although her existence is joyless, she refuses to leave #Y_0# for a new life, proving that wealth’s hold is difficult to overcome.

-- #X_0# --
The first black doctor in the novel’s #Y_0# town. #X_0# is an arrogant, self-hating racist who calls fellow African-Americans “cannibals” and checks to see how light-skinned his granddaughters are when they are born. His status as an educated black man at a time when many blacks were illiterate makes him an important symbol of personal triumph while contrasting with his racist attitude.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s daughter and #X_1#’s mother, also known as #X_3#. #X_0# has a strong sexual drive but is attracted to abusive men. Nevertheless, because #X_2# is her mother, the few men who dare mistreat her are punished. #X_0#’s uncanny ability to win contests such as the #Y_0# half-millionth customer diamond ring giveaway demonstrates that wealth is transient and unimportant.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s worldly sister, educated at #Y_0# and in #Y_1#. #X_0# #X_0# shares her name with a New Testament book in which the apostle Paul seeks to mend the disagreements within the early Christian church. Like the biblical book, the character #X_0# #X_0# tries to unify people. Her passionate love affair with a yardman, #X_2#, crosses class boundaries. Her actions prove that human beings of different backgrounds and ages can share a bond.

-- #X_0# --
Another of #X_4#’s sisters, also known as #X_2#. #X_2#’s submissive attitude in #X_3# home makes her one of the many submissive women who populate Song of Solomon. But her rebuke of #X_4#’s selfishness demonstrates her inner strength.

-- #X_0# --
The #Y_0# poet laureate. #X_0# is a liberal who writes sentimental poetry and hires First Corinthians as a maid. #X_0# represents the double standard of white liberals. Although they claimed to support universal human rights, liberal whites often refused to treat African-Americans as equals.

-- #X_0# --
A maid and midwife who worked for the wealthy #X_1# family. #X_2# delivered #X_4# and #X_7#. In her encounter with #X_5#, #X_2# plays the same role as her namesake in #X_3#’s Odyssey, the ancient Greek account of a lost mariner’s ten-year voyage home. Just as #X_3#’s #X_2# helps Odysseus find his way back to #Y_0#, #X_6#’s #X_2# provides crucial information that reconnects #X_5# with his family history. In this way, #X_6#’s #X_2# connects #X_5#’s past and future.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s grandmother and #X_1# wife. #X_4# is an Indian woman also known as #X_4#ing Bird. #X_4#’s name commands #Y_0#, #X_3#, and #X_2# to connect the missing links of their family history through #X_6#’s song.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s lover and a member of the #Y_0# vigilante group, which murders white people. #X_0#’s tender love affair with #X_1# proves that a personal connection between two human beings is stronger than differences of background and class.

-- #X_0# --
An insurance agent and member of the #Y_1# vigilante group. #X_0#’s attempt to fly off of the roof of #Y_0# begins the novel’s exploration of flight as a means of escape. #X_0#’s failure to fly contrasts with #X_1#’s eventual success in escaping the confining circumstances of his life.

-- #X_0# --
A janitor employed by #X_2# #X_1# is the town gossip. #X_1# spreads rumors through the town, illustrating how information was often disseminated within African-American communities. #X_1# coins the nickname “#X_3#” for #X_4#’s son, showing that original names are often forgotten and replaced.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s great-grandfather, who supposedly flew back to Africa but dropped his son #X_1# shortly after taking off. #X_0#’s flight is a physical demonstration of the liberation that is felt when a person escapes confining circumstances. However, #X_0#’s crying wife, #X_3#, and traumatized children show that escape has negative consequences as well.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s great-grandmother and #X_2#’s wife. When #X_2# abandons her, #X_0# goes mad. According to legend, her cries can still be heard.

-- #X_0# --
A prostitute with whom #X_2# has a brief affair. Unlike #X_2#’s affairs with other women, especially #X_1#, his relationship with #X_3# is mutually respectful and entirely reciprocal. His interactions with her demonstrate that the most gratifying relationships in the novel are those in which both partners treat each other as equals.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s older brother. Compared to #X_1# and many of the young men in #Y_0#, the narrator is a success, working as a math teacher and raising a family. However, he also feels trapped in #Y_0#, where he has lived his entire life. He knows he has an obligation to #X_1#, but it takes him a while to get over his skepticism and devote himself to helping #X_1# as best he can.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator’s wayward younger brother. #X_0# is a troubled young man who becomes addicted to heroin at an early age. Unlike many of the young boys in the neighborhood, #X_0# is not hard or brutal. He keeps all of his problems bottled up—except when he plays music. Music, for #X_0#, is a freeing and ultimately redemptive outlet and perhaps the only means he has for keeping himself away from prison and drugs. He channels into his performance not only his own frustration and disappointment but also that of the entire community.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator’s wife. Unlike the narrator, #X_0# can make #X_1# feel comfortably at home in their house after #X_1# is released from prison. She draws him out of his shell and makes him laugh. She can, in her own way, accept #X_1# with less hesitation than the narrator. She is a caring wife and mother who watches over the narrator much the same way his mother watched over his father.

-- #X_0# --
The mother of #X_1# and the narrator. She dies while #X_1# is still a boy. Before she dies, she expresses her deep concerns about #X_1#’s future to the narrator. She is acutely aware of the dangers facing her youngest son, and her final request to the narrator is that he protect his brother, just as she protected their father. Kind and loving, she has spent much of her life trying to protect her family from the darkness of the world.

-- #X_0# --
A drug addict who meets the narrator early in the story to tell him what happened to #X_1#. Despite his addiction, he is able to eloquently explain the hardship that comes with drug addiction. He is a troubled, nameless soul whose brief presence in the story speaks for the countless young men in Harlem who struggle with a drug addiction.

-- #X_0# --
The father of #X_1# and the narrator. He has the same spirit as #X_1#, and as a result he fights constantly with his son. When he was a young man, he lost his brother and was haunted by it his entire life. He constantly searched for a better reality but died without finding it.

-- #X_0# --
The leader of #X_2#’s band. An imposing older black man, #X_0# guides #X_2# through his performance at the end of the story. He controls the playing of every member in the band.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator’s daughter. #X_0# dies of polio while #X_1# is prison. Her death prompts the narrator to write to #X_1#. Her dying, although not discussed in great detail, becomes an act of grace, allowing the narrator to reach out to his brother for the first time.

-- #X_0# --
The first protagonist of the novel. She becomes unhappy with her husband #X_1# and devotes herself to her children.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#takes over from his mother as the protagonist in the second half of the book. After his brother #X_2#’s death, #X_0# becomes his mother’s favorite and struggles throughout the novel to balance his love for her with his relationships with other women.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s husband, a coal miner.

-- #X_0# --
Their first son, who is Mrs. #X_0#’s favorite until he falls ill and dies.

-- #X_0# --
A girl #X_2# sees in #Y_0#, and to whom he becomes engaged. The rest of the family is less than impressed with her when he brings her home, and #X_2# shortly becomes sick of her as well.

-- #X_0# --
The family who live at #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the novel. #X_0# is naïve and self-absorbed but also kind and open-hearted. He is intelligent but unsophisticated and longs to gain more knowledge of the world around him. #X_0# is also torn between pride in his identity as a Southerner and an awareness of the terrible legacies of racism and violence that exist in this region.

-- #X_0# --
A Polish woman who is #X_2#’s lover and becomes close to #X_3# over the course of the novel. She is seductive and elegant but also inclined to melancholy. #X_0# is haunted by guilt, anger, and self-loathing. She is secretive and manages her traumatic past by hiding it away.

-- #X_0# --
A Jewish man who lives in the boarding house with #X_2# and is in a romantic relationship with #X_1#. #X_0# is charismatic, charming, and can be warm and nurturing. He is extremely intelligent and likes to debate. However, #X_0# is erratic and can become extremely angry and violent.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s father, a law professor. A harsh, repressive, and fiercely anti-Semitic man, he forced #X_1# to help him distribute pamphlets advocating for the Nazi cause. He dies in a prison camp after being rounded up by the Nazis with other Polish intellectuals.

-- #X_0# --
A Nazi official who manages the camp at #Y_0# during the time #X_1# is imprisoned there. He is a cold and ruthless man who is driven by efficiency and able to ignore the depravity of his actions. He is obsessed with Aryan ideology and desires #X_1# because she conforms to Aryan standards of beauty. #X_0# is a cowardly man who does not fulfil his promises.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s Polish husband. #X_0# is passive and falls under the sway of #X_1#’s father. He has been cruel to #X_1# and they have an unfulfilling marriage. He is killed by Nazis after the German invasion of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A Southern gentleman who lives on a comfortable income in #Y_0#. He has a loving and tender relationship with his son but also respects #X_0# desire for independence. He has a strong respect for tradition and the past but is also liberal in his politics and deplores racism.

-- #X_0# --
The owner of the boarding house where #X_3#, #X_1#, and #X_2# live. She is a no-nonsense woman, but she is also relaxed and free-thinking.

-- #X_0# --
A man who lives at the boarding house with #X_3#, #X_1#, and #X_2#. He is nosy and likes to gossip about what is going on amongst the other tenants. His curiosity and knowledge eventually become useful because he is able to provide information to #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
A Polish prisoner who works as a handyman at #Y_0# and is given privileges because he is a favorite of #X_2#. #X_0# has a clown-like personality that he uses to disguise that he is intelligent. #X_0# is actually a loyalist who wants to undermine the Nazis.

-- #X_0# --
A prisoner who lives at the #X_1# household and serves as a governess for the #X_1# children. #X_0# is kindly but convinces herself that the Jews deserve the treatment they are getting from the Nazis so that she can avoid feeling sympathy for them.

#X_1#’s daughter. #X_0# is a joyous young girl with musical talent.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s young daughter who confronts #X_2# as #X_2# is trying to steal a radio. #X_0# has been brainwashed by the Nazi propaganda she has grown up with, and even though she is a young child, she has no sense of compassion for others.

-- #X_0# --
A close friend to #X_1#. #X_0# is optimistic, talkative, friendly, and encouraging.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# sister-in-law, a young woman whom #X_2# pursues a relationship with. #X_0# is very religious and conservative in her morality. She does not trust men, and she is unwilling to be seduced by #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the protagonist of #X_0#'s World. She is an inquisitive and spirited fourteen year old who learns just before turning fifteen that her life is the invention of #X_1#. #X_0# learns this and many other things from #X_2# Knox, the philosopher who #X_1# invented as her teacher. #X_0# does not just learn from #X_2#; she also questions him and shows that she has ideas of her own to implement. By the end of the story #X_0# shows that she is a philosopher, because she has the ability to look at things from a different perspective and she can act on what she thinks. #X_0# is friendly but not all that social. She is more given to introspection than chatting. In fact, #X_0# almost forgets about her one good friend, #X_4#, when she starts learning about philosophy. #X_0# is critical, and she does not spare those she cares about. Her mother has to listen to much criticism from #X_0# throughout the book, and #X_4# and #X_2# also hear a fair share. #X_0# is opinionated and she is interested in saying only what she thinks.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s teacher, #X_0# represents the ideal philosopher. He is never quick to judge and he always thinks about what he is doing. #X_0# believes passionately in philosophy, since it helps him understand that his existence is due to the mind of #X_1#. #X_0# is an excellent teacher because he forces #X_2# to think things out on her own and does not make things easy for her but he also cares about her and wants her to learn.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is Albert #X_0#'s daughter and #X_3# and #X_2# are created for her amusement. Like #X_3#, she is a deep thinker, and the philosophy in the book intrigues her deeply. #X_0# is also extremely compassionate, and she feels for #X_3# and #X_2# while her father plays with their lives. She is independent, and proves it by giving her father a taste of his own medicine during his return from #Y_0#. #X_0# thinks things through but also trusts her instincts over her reason sometimes, and her instinct is what tells her that #X_3# actually exists.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s father, #X_0#is the brains behind #X_4# and #X_0#o's existence. He creates them as a birthday gift for his daughter, whom he loves deeply. #X_0#has an ironic sense of humor and cares very much about the world. He works for the #Y_0# and he wants people to live in peace and harmony. #X_0# also very much wants his daughter to see the world (and the universe) as the special place that it is. He wants her to learn about philosophy so that she will be able to think and live in the way that he thinks is proper. Like #X_0#o, he is a philosopher at heart, and the world itself is enough entertainment for him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s mother is one of the funnier characters in the book because she provides a foil for #X_3#'s philosophical adventures. Mrs. #X_2# thinks that her daughter is losing her mind when she starts spouting off about the differences between humans and animals and how thinking makes one a human being. Sadly, she also represents those who do not think in the world, a population that, #X_1# warns #X_3#, includes most of the people.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_2#'s best friend and she is loyal and friendly, although she does not think about things in the same way that #X_2# does. But #X_0# also will not turn away from philosophy in the same way that #X_2#'s mother does. So #X_0# shows some promise. Perhaps if she had a philosophy course she would progress in the same way that #X_2# did.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s mother is a very minor character in the book. The relationship between #X_1# and her father is much more central, but #X_1# mother often provides a stabilizing influence in her daughter's life. We do not know how deep of a thinker she is, but it is clear that she loves her husband and her daughter very much.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s father is hardly mentioned throughout the book. He sends his daughter a postcard early on and it is clear that he cares for her, but his work keeps him away from home for most of the year.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_2#'s dog who works as a messenger, bringing #X_4# the lectures on philosophy and later taking her to #X_2#. #X_1# uses #X_0# to wish #X_3# happy birthday and help ruin the continuity of #X_4#'s life.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the boy who #X_1# begins passionately kissing at the end of the garden party. #X_2# invites him because she knows that #X_1# wants him at the party.

-- #X_0# --

A nobleman at court. He takes an interest in #X_2#, who in turn esteems the count. The #X_0#’s lack of a formal higher education may make him fear for the security of his higher social status, which is perhaps the reason that he ultimately does not defend #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
A noblewoman who lives with her widowed aunt, who is also of noble lineage. She also knows #X_1#harlotte and likes her very much. She enjoys the time that she and #X_3# spend together, but like #X_1#ount #X_1#—she also does not defend him.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The author and narrator of the book. #X_0# #X_0# writes several chapters in first person, therefore becoming a main character. He is a well-educated Black man who wants education for his people. He strives to be an example for both Black and white people of how they should treat one another. His ideas for creating a more egalitarian society are pragmatic, but his optimism in the face of adversity reveals him to be idealistic as well.

-- #X_0# --
An educator and author. His primary objective is to see his people receive industrial education so that they can amass material wealth and appease white Southerners in the process. He is a foil to #X_1# because he, despite being a Black man himself, advocates for assimilation into white culture. #X_1# does not describe #X_0# personally, but he reveals aspects of #X_0#’s character by detailing his actions and beliefs.

-- #X_0# --
A Black clergyman whom #X_1# treasures as a friend. He was educated in the North and felt a calling to become an Episcopal priest, but the Episcopal seminary he sought to attend denied him entry because of his race.

He worked nobly his entire life, and despite receiving pushback from the churches where he sought institutional support, he did not doubt his calling.

-- #X_0# --
A former student of #X_1#. He is a good-natured man who experiences satisfaction with the world early in his life, but he travels to the North for an education and becomes aware of the realities of life as a Black man after he graduates from college.

-- #X_0# --
A white judge. He begrudgingly hires #X_3# when he returns from college, but only so that #X_4# can teach the other Black people to be loyal servants. His racism is on full display when he fires #X_4# a month later for teaching about the equality of Black people.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The pastor who delivers a powerful sermon on Easter Sunday at the local Black church in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# protagonist of the story, who is referred to only as "the #X_0#." #X_0# story focuses on the #X_0#'s search for #X_1# and his father, both of whom he loses on the same night. #X_0#comes of age as the novel progresses, especially in his helping raise his siblings and filling the void left behind by his father. In addition to his constant search for his father and #X_1#, the #X_0# learns to read and finally moves out of the cabin in pursuit of an education.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0# is an absent character for the most part, since he is in jail for much of the text. Before his arrest and conviction, though, he plays a typical paternal role, supporting his family by hunting. Providing for the family becomes increasingly difficult, and it is when his responsibility as a provider reaches near impossibility that he steals to feed his family, triggering the string of events that eventually lead to his imprisonment. He is stoic, quiet, and expresses little emotion even when his son visits him in jail. At the end, he is injured much like #X_1#, significantly beaten, and broken by his stint as a convict.

-- #X_0# --
While the #X_0# #X_0# is an understood key character in the text—taking care of the entire family in her husband's absence—her role is significantly downplayed. She remains strong after her husband's arrest, working to support her family and to remain optimistic despite the tragic events that have befallen her family. She is very sensitive to the boy and discourages him from searching for his father and #X_1#, though supporting him when he does. She does not complain about the circumstances and increased difficulty of their situation and is the rock that holds the family together when her husband is put in jail.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, in many ways, is living a life parallel to the boy's father. They are taken from the family at the same time, and they both eventually find their way back after having sustained serious injury. Before being shot, #X_0#is the most vocal member of the entire family, announcing his presence with a gigantic bark and howl that rings across the valley. #X_0#represents strength and loyalty, much like the boy's father does.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is the only person outside of the boy's family who treats him with kindness. In a sense, the #X_0# fills the void the boy's father left behind, but he also, more importantly, provides the boy with a future and the possibility for improvement. #X_0#seems to implicitly understand the boy's plight, and the #X_0# knows that books bring the boy pleasure. It is through reading that the #X_0# and the boy grow to be friends. #X_0# boy's seemingly random run in with the #X_0# is an extremely lucky circumstance or else is representative of divine intervention.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#is needlessly evil and personifies many of the obstacles that the boy and the entire family face. He immediately picks on the boy, not showing compassion or even decency. It seems as if the #X_0# delights in frightening the boy, as he does when he destroys the cake the boy has brought for his father. #X_0#illustrates how the boy can feel as if the rest of the world is against him and exemplifies how hard it is to achieve improvement in life with such authority pitted against him.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator and protagonist. #X_0#is a wife and mother who finds her life disrupted when Indians take her captive after the attack on #Y_0#. #X_0# finds solace in the Bible during her captivity, and her charity and kindness prompt her to help others when she is able, often by helping them find solace in the Bible as well. As her time with the Indians progresses, however, #X_0# becomes less sure of her own moral high ground and less certain of the savagery of her captors. She begins to realize the capacity for savagery that lies within all people, even Christians, and this knowledge haunts her even after her return to civilization. But she is grateful to God for her redemption and writes her story as a way of teaching other settlers about God’s power and grace.

-- #X_0# --
Mary #X_0#’s husband. #X_0# #X_0# is away in #Y_0# when the attack on #Y_1# takes place. He is a faithful husband who uses his ties to the church to help free his family and other captives.

-- #X_0# --
The only living son of #X_0# and Mary #X_0#. #X_0# is only thirteen years old when he is taken captive in the attack on #Y_0#. Pious, responsible #X_0# visits his mother whenever he can, and the two of them pray and read the Bible together.

-- #X_0# --
The eldest daughter of #X_2# and #X_0# #X_0#. #X_0# is ten years old when she is taken captive and separated from her family. Like #X_2#, she is brave and pious and visits her mother whenever she can.

-- #X_0# --
The youngest daughter of the #X_0#s. #X_0# is taken captive along with her mother when she is only six years old. She is badly wounded in the attack on #Y_0# and dies relatively early into #X_0#’s captivity.

-- #X_0# --
The unstable, unreliable leader of the Wampanoag Indians. At times, #X_0# reassures #X_2# that she’ll soon be free. But when her redemption is near, he tries to bypass the structure of the council, refusing to meet with the rest of the Indians in their #Y_0# and promising #X_2# her freedom in exchange for food and goods. #X_0# may be unreliable, but he is not unkind, and the ambivalence of #X_2#’s attitude toward #X_0# suggests the larger uncertainty #X_2# has about her captors’ savageness and her own civilized nature.

-- #X_0# --
A captive colonist who proves helpful to #X_1#. #X_0# meets #X_1# after he has already been traveling with the Indians for some time. Like #X_1#, he had a wound to tend to when he was first taken captive. He shares with #X_1# the folk knowledge he learned from the Indians, teaching her how oak leaves can help to heal her. #X_0#, who has learned how to use nature to his advantage, is a positive example of a settler negotiating the world of the wilderness.

-- #X_0# --
A young settler from #Y_1# whom the Indians hold captive. #X_0# is ill and suffering when #X_1# visits him in a settlement near #Y_0#. Underclothed and left outside, along with an orphaned Indian baby, #X_0# moves #X_1# to pity. His predicament exemplifies the Indians’ cruelty and the extent to which all captives are reduced to dependence on the kindness of strangers.

-- #X_0# --
An English settler who is friendly with the “praying Indians” of #Y_1#. Kind, diplomatic #X_0# acts as a messenger and helps to negotiate #X_2#’s release. He arrives at #Y_2# with letters to King #X_1# from the council in #Y_0#, and when #X_2# is freed, he travels back to #Y_0# with her. Well-connected in both Indian and British circles, #X_0# provides a means for settlers to interact with Indians without losing any of their own civility.

-- #X_0# --
Another captive #X_1# meets in the middle of her captivity. #X_0# tells #X_1# her husband is alive and well. As a settler, #X_0# is a reliable and trustworthy source of information, unlike the Indians.

-- #X_0# --
Another captive #X_1# meets near the end of her captivity. #X_0# lends #X_1# her hat when #X_1# is bothered by the sun’s glare. This act of charity and kindness marks #X_0# as a good Christian.

-- #X_0# --
“Praying Indians” and acquaintances of #X_2#. #X_0# act as messengers between the council of the colonists and #Y_0#, helping to negotiate freedom for the captives.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#’s three wives. #X_0# is proud and vain, concerned primarily with wealth, status, and her own appearance. She is generally unkind to #X_2#, and only when #X_2#’s freedom approaches does she begin treating her better, possibly because she wants some of the ransom money the settlers will offer. #X_0# serves as a foil to #X_2#: her negative qualities contrast strongly with #X_2#’s positive characteristics.

-- #X_0# --
The oldest of #X_1#’s three wives. #X_0# is kind to #X_2#, unlike #X_3#, another of #X_1#’s wives. When #X_2# arrives in #Y_0#, #X_1# asks #X_0# to tend to #X_2#’s needs, and #X_0# feeds her a meal of beans, meat, and ground-nut cake. As an Indian who is willing to treat a captive decently, #X_0# demonstrates the kindness and compassion that can exist even among people who are presumed to be savages and who are, in wartime, the enemy.

-- #X_0# --
A Saggamore Indian who is related to King Philip by virtue of being married to Philip’s wife’s sister. #X_0# is #X_1#’s master when she is among the Indians. Having purchased #X_1# from the Indian who originally took her captive, #X_0# is generally kind and decent to her. He is not always present to make sure #X_1# is well-treated, however. For several weeks of #X_1#’s captivity, #X_0# travels elsewhere among the Indian settlements, leaving #X_1# in the care of one of his three wives.

-- #X_0# --
A kind settler who lives in #Y_0#. #X_0# shelters the #X_2# in his home for eleven weeks after #X_1# release from captivity.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the story. #X_0#starts out as a loyal servant to the King. He is the King's Knight-Marshal and is in charge of organizing entertainments at royal events. At the beginning of the play, he is a minor character, especially in relation to #X_4#, #X_2#, and #X_3#. It is not until he discovers his son Horatio's murdered body in the second Act that he becomes the protagonist of the play. His character undergoes a radical shift over the course of the play, from grieving father to Machiavellian plotter. After his son's murder, he is constantly pushes the limits of sanity, as evidenced by his erratic speech and behavior.

-- #X_0# --
The main female character of the story. #X_0#'s role is prominent in the plot, especially toward the end. The daugher of the Duke of #X_3#, she is headstrong, as evidenced by her decisions to love #X_1# and #X_5#, both against her father's wishes. She is intelligent, beautiful, and, in moments of love, tender. She also is bent on revenge, both for her slain lover #X_1# and for #X_5#. Her transformation into a Machiavellian villain is not as dramatic as #X_4#'s, but only because she shows signs of Machiavellian behavior beforehand—her decision to love #X_5#, in part, may have been calculated revenge, undertaken in order to spite Balthazar, #X_1#'s killer.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#'s murderers. #X_0#'s character remains fairly constant throughout the play. He is a proud verbal manipulator and a Machiavellian plotter. A great deceiver and manipulator of others, #X_1# unsurprisingly has an enthusiasm for the theater. #X_0#has a foil in #X_1#; they are both brave young men, but #X_1#'s directness, impulsiveness, and honesty, contrast and highlight #X_0#'s guardedness, secretiveness, and deception.

-- #X_0# --
The prince of #Y_0# and son of the Portuguese Viceroy. #X_0# is characterized by his extreme pride and his hot-headedness. This pride makes him kill #X_3# along with #X_4#, and it turns him into a villain. He kills #X_1# fairly, though with help, so it is unclear whether he is as "valiant" as the King and others continuously describe him. But his love for #X_2# is genuine, and it is this love that primarily motivates his killing of #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The proud, promising son of #X_3#. #X_0#sense of duty and loyalty is shown in his actions towards #X_2#, and he gives #X_2# the funeral rites that let the ghost cross the river Acheron in the underworld. He also captures #X_2#'s killer, Balthazar, in battle, thus recovering #X_2#'s body. His sense of pride is shown in his confrontation with #X_4#; though #X_4# greatly outranks him in stature, he does not defer, but instead continues to argue his case in front of the King.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#'s ghost is the first character we see in the play, and the first voice to cry out for revenge. His quest for revenge can be seen both as a quest for justice, since it is sanctioned by #X_1#, the Queen of the Underworld, and as a quest for closure. #X_0# is denied closure when he travels to the underworld, because the three judges there cannot decide where to place him; ironically, at the end of the play he becomes a judge himself, determining the places of the various characters in hell.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s companion throughout the play. #X_0# is a spirit that symbolizes the forces of revenge that dominate the play's action. He talks of the living characters as if they were performing a tragedy for his entertainment.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s suffering wife, her inaction is a foil to his and #X_1# action. Her inaction, along with her visions of a dead #X_3#, torment her increasingly throughout the play, providing an extreme version of #X_2#'s more subdued madness. Her death by her own hand foreshadows #X_2#'s suicide.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#of Spain is an ambivalent character. At times he appears noble and is definitely a friend to #X_1#, resisiting #X_2#'s attempts to have the Knight-Marshal dismissed. But he is also complacent (a typical English stereotype about the Spanish), as demonstrated by his callous conversation after the Spanish victory in Act I, his subsequent dialogue with the ambassador, and his failure to know that Horatio has been murdered on his estate.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# King's counterpart in #Y_0#. #X_0#is shown as both a loving father but also a weak king. He is defeated in battle, wallows in self-pity when he believes his son Balthazar to be dead, is easily led astray by #X_2# into condemning #X_1# to death, and then renounces his kingship in favor of his son. All of these are signs of bad leadership, especially to an Elizabethan audience.

-- #X_0# --
#Y_0#'s servant. #X_0# is easily bribed, and he betrays #Y_0# and is one of the gang of four murderers who kill #X_1#. In fact, #X_0# seems to have no moral considerations, only following the person whom he thinks can help him most. Ironically, this leads him to trust #X_2#, who ends up betraying him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s manservant who, along with #X_4#, #X_1#, and #X_5#, kills #X_3#. #X_4# suspects #X_0# of informing #X_2# of the crime, and has him killed by #X_5#.

-- #X_0# --
An old man. #X_0# visits #X_2# because his own son has been murdered, and he wants the Knight-Marshal's help in finding justice. The appearance of the old man makes #X_2# feel ashamed at his own inability to avenge Horatio's death.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# Portuguese #X_0# is the agent of communication between the King and Viceroy. His presence appears purely functional, exchanging information between the Portuguese and Spanish court.

-- #X_0# --
A Portuguese nobleman who fought at the battle in Act I. #X_0# is betrayed by #X_2#, who falsely informs the King that #X_0# has shot Balthazar, the King's son. #X_0#'s character appears exceptionally just; even when #X_2# is discovered, he begs the Viceroy (unsuccessfully) for mercy on #X_2#'s behalf.

-- #X_0# --
A nobleman who, for no reason clear to the audience, betrays #X_1#. #X_0#'s role is so short and so tied in with his lie about #X_1# that he almost serves as a personifcation of deceit, contrasting against #X_1#'s personification of honor.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# simply describes the battle between #Y_1# and #Y_0# in Act I. His account of #X_1#'s death (or lack of account of it) and description of the #X_0# casualties as minimal provides an ironic contrast to #X_1#'s lamenting of his death in battle.

-- #X_0# --
A servant who attends on Bel-Imperia while she is kept prisoner by #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# hangman is witty and jovial, and he exchanges verbal retorts with #X_4# before hanging him. Later, the hangman discovers the letter on #X_4#'s body that confirms #X_2#'s suspicions of #X_3# and #X_1#'s guilt.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# page is a messenger boy who brings #X_2#'s empty box to the execution, which is believed to hold a pardon for #X_3#. After the page looks inside, he does not tell anyone that it is empty, out of fear for his own life. This has a distinct impact on the play, since #X_3#'s belief that he will be pardoned stops him from exposing #X_2# as one of #X_1#'s murderers before it is too late.

-- #X_0# --
A thirteen-year-old high school freshman and the novel’s protagonist. #X_0#’s biting sarcasm and observant mind quickly pick up on the unstated rules of high school, but trauma from an incident in her past relegates her to a position as a social outcast. Isolated from her friends and family, she must find her place in the world without much support. Intelligent, athletic, and wise beyond her years, #X_0# comes of age while healing from trauma.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s lab partner. Ambitious and friendly, #X_0# impresses #X_2# by speaking up for himself to the overbearing teacher who strikes fear in her. Unlike #X_2#, #X_0# has supportive parents who defend him against unfair school policies. #X_0#’s career goals change weekly because he has so much potential.

-- #X_0# --
A teacher at #Y_0#. While most of the school’s teachers are aloof, uncaring, and absurd, #X_0# represents the opposite—a genuine, caring adult who truly wants to help young people learn how to deal with life. While several adults in the story question why #X_1# won’t speak, #X_0# lets her know through his words and actions that he really wants to listen.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s parents, who are largely absent from the novel. They are well-meaning but busy parents who love #X_1# but don’t know how to help her. #X_0# owns a clothing store in the city and #X_0# sells insurance.

-- #X_0# --
A lovely young hedonist and courtesan. #X_0#resembles Romantic stereotypes such as the #X_3#-Sophia figure, the noble whore, and the loving sister.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist and narrator of The Stranger, to whom the novel’s title refers. #X_0# is a detached figure who views and describes much of what occurs around him from a removed position. He is emotionally indifferent to others, even to his mother and his lover, #X_1#. He also refuses to adhere to the accepted moral order of society. After #X_0# kills a man, “the Arab,” for no apparent reason, he is put on trial. However, the focus of #X_0#’s murder trial quickly shifts away from the murder itself to #X_0#’s attitudes and beliefs. #X_0#’s atheism and his lack of outward grief at his mother’s funeral represent a serious challenge to the morals of the society in which he lives. Consequently, society brands him an outsider.

-- #X_0# --
A former co-worker of #X_2# who begins an affair with him the day after his mother’s funeral. #X_0# is young and high-spirited, and delights in swimming and the outdoors. #X_2#’s interest in #X_0# seems primarily the result of her physical beauty. #X_0# does not seem to understand #X_2#, but she feels drawn to #X_2#’s peculiarities nevertheless. Even when #X_2# expresses indifference toward marrying her, she still wants to be his wife, and she tries to support him during his arrest and trial.

-- #X_0# --
A local pimp and #X_1#’s neighbor. #X_0# becomes angry when he suspects his mistress is cheating on him, and in his plan to punish her, he enlists #X_1#’s help. In contrast to #X_1#’s calm detachment, #X_0# behaves with emotion and initiative. He is also violent, and beats his mistress as well as the two Arabs on the beach, one of whom is his mistress’s brother. #X_0# seems to be using #X_1#, whom he can easily convince to help him in his schemes. However, that #X_0# tries to help #X_1# with his testimony during the trial shows that #X_0# does possess some capacity for loyalty.

-- #X_0# --
Madame #X_0# death begins the action of the novel. Three years prior, #X_2# sent her to an old persons’ home. #X_2# identifies with his mother and believes that she shared many of his attitudes about life, including a love of nature and the capacity to become accustomed to virtually any situation or occurrence. Most important, #X_2# decides that, toward the end of her life, his mother must have embraced a meaningless universe and lived for the moment, just as he does.

-- #X_0# --
A priest who attends to the religious needs of condemned men, the chaplain acts as a catalyst for #X_1#’s psychological and philosophical development. After #X_1# is found guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced to death, he repeatedly refuses to see the chaplain. #X_0# chaplain visits #X_1# anyway, and nearly demands that he take comfort in God. #X_0# chaplain seems threatened by #X_1#’s stubborn atheism. Eventually, #X_1# becomes enraged and angrily asserts that life is meaningless and that all men are condemned to die. This argument triggers #X_1#’s final acceptance of the meaninglessness of the universe.

-- #X_0# --
One of the elderly residents at the old persons’ home where #X_1#’s mother lived. Before Madame #X_1#’s death, she and #X_0# had become so inseparable that the other residents joked that he was her fiancé. #X_0#’s relationship with Madame #X_1# is one of the few genuine emotional attachments the novel depicts. #X_0#, as someone who expresses his love for Madame #X_1#, serves as a foil the indifferent narrator.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# magistrate questions #X_1# several times after his arrest. Deeply disturbed by #X_1#’s apparent lack of grief over his mother’s death, the magistrate brandishes a crucifix at #X_1# and demands to know whether he believes in God. When #X_1# reasserts his atheism, the magistrate states that the meaning of his own life is threatened by #X_1#’s lack of belief. #X_0# magistrate represents society at large in that he is threatened by #X_1#’s unusual, amoral beliefs.

-- #X_0# --
A worker at the old persons’ home where #X_1#’s mother spent the three years prior to her death. During the vigil #X_1# holds before his mother’s funeral, the caretaker chats with #X_1# in the mortuary. #X_0#y drink coffee and smoke cigarettes next to the coffin, gestures that later weigh heavily against #X_1# as evidence of his monstrous indifference to his mother’s death. It is peculiar that the court does not consider the caretaker’s smoking and coffee drinking in the presence of the coffin to be similarly monstrous acts.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# manager of the old persons’ home where #X_1#’s mother spent her final three years. When #X_1# arrives to keep vigil before his mother’s funeral, the director assures him that he should not feel guilty for having sent her to the home. However, by raising the issue, the director implies that perhaps #X_1# has done something wrong. When #X_1# goes on trial, the director becomes suddenly judgmental. During his testimony, he casts #X_1#’s actions in a negative light.

-- #X_0# --
The proprietor of a café where #X_1# frequently eats lunch. #X_0# remains loyal to #X_1# during his murder trial. He testifies that #X_1# is an honest, decent man, and he states that bad luck led #X_1# to kill the Arab. #X_0#’s assertion that the murder had no rational cause and was simply a case of bad luck reveals a worldview similar to #X_1#’s.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_3#’s friends, who invites #X_3#, #X_2#, and #X_1# to spend a Sunday at his beach house with him and his wife. It is during this ill-fated trip to #X_0#’s beach house that #X_2# kills the Arab. #X_0# is a vigorous, seemingly contented figure, and he testifies to #X_2#’s good character during #X_2#’s trial.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# lawyer who argues against #X_2# at the trial. During his closing arguments, the prosecutor characterizes #X_2# as a cool, calculating monster, using #X_2#’s lack of an emotional attachment to his mother as his primary evidence. He demands the death penalty for #X_2#, arguing that #X_2#’s moral indifference threatens all of society and therefore must be stamped out.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#’s neighbors. #X_0# owns an old dog that suffers from mange, and he frequently curses at and beats his pet. However, after #X_0# loses his dog, he weeps and longs for its return. His strong grief over losing his dog contrasts with #X_1#’s indifference at losing his mother.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# brother of #X_4#’s mistress. On the Sunday that #X_4#, #X_3#, and #X_1# spend at #X_2#’s beach house, #X_3# kills the #X_0# with #X_4#’s gun. #X_0# crime is apparently motiveless—the #X_0# has done nothing to #X_3#. #X_0#’s mysteriousness as a character makes #X_3#’s crime all the more strange and difficult to understand.

-- #X_0# --
Human born on Mars to two Earth explorers aboard the spaceship Champion. Orphaned as an infant, #X_1# is raised by the Martian race. He grows up with human physiology but Martian psychology. When he is brought to Earth as an adult, age twenty-five, he brings knowledge of telekinesis and mind reading abilities, as well as a Martian worldview utterly removed from anything in Earth culture. #X_1# develops a deep curiosity about Earthling ways, and he endeavors to understand the human concepts that he has been raised without, such as jealousy, lust, showmanship, fiction, and religion.

-- #X_0# --
A famous doctor, lawyer, and writer. He has lived a long life, full of adventure and accomplishment, and now leads a comfortable lifestyle in his estate with his secretaries and assistants.

A newspaper reporter who writes a muckraking political column that has earned him the ire of the Earth's government. #X_0# is driven partially by a newspaperman's inherent lust for a scintillating story, and partially by a passion for social justice.

The babies born #X_7# and #X_6# respectively. Their paternity is ambiguous, though #X_3# suspects that #X_0# was fathered by #X_5#, and #X_0# by either #X_5# or #X_4#, who is married to #X_6# when she has the baby.

-- #X_0# --
#X_5#’s older sister, who was a high school English teacher in #Y_0#, #Y_1#, until she was forced to leave her post. #X_0# is a loquacious and fragile woman around the age of thirty. After losing #X_1#, the #X_0# family home, #X_0# arrives in #Y_2# at the #X_2# apartment and eventually reveals that she is completely destitute. Though she has strong sexual urges and has had many lovers, she puts on the airs of a woman who has never known indignity. She avoids reality, preferring to live in her own imagination. As the play progresses, #X_0#’s instability grows along with her misfortune. #X_4# sees through #X_0# and finds out the details of her past, destroying her relationship with his friend #X_3#. #X_4# also destroys what’s left of #X_0# by raping her and then having her committed to an insane asylum.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s younger sister, about twenty-five years old and of a mild disposition that visibly sets her apart from her more vulgar neighbors. #X_0# possesses the same timeworn aristocratic heritage as #X_1#, but she jumped the sinking ship in her late teens and left #Y_0# for #Y_1#. There, #X_0# married lower-class #X_2#, with whom she shares a robust sexual relationship. #X_0#’s union with #X_2# is both animal and spiritual, violent but renewing. After #X_1#’s arrival, #X_0# is torn between her sister and her husband. Eventually, she stands by #X_2#, perhaps in part because she gives birth to his child near the play’s end. While she loves and pities #X_1#, she cannot bring herself to believe #X_1#’s accusations that #X_2# dislikes #X_1#, and she eventually dismisses #X_1#’s claim that #X_2# raped her. #X_0#’s denial of reality at the play’s end shows that she has more in common with her sister than she thinks.

-- #X_0# --
The husband of #X_2#. #X_0# is the epitome of vital force. He is loyal to his friends, passionate to his wife, and heartlessly cruel to #X_1#. With his Polish ancestry, he represents the new, heterogeneous #Y_0#. He sees himself as a social leveler, and wishes to destroy #X_1#’s social pretensions. Around thirty years of age, #X_0#, who fought in World War II, now works as an auto-parts salesman. Practicality is his forte, and he has no patience for #X_1#’s distortions of the truth. He lacks ideals and imagination. By the play’s end, he is a disturbing degenerate: he beats his wife and rapes his sister-in-law. Horrifyingly, he shows no remorse. Yet, #X_1# is an outcast from society, while #X_0# is the proud family man.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#’s army friend, coworker, and poker buddy, who courts #X_2# until he finds out that she lied to him about her sordid past. #X_3#, like #X_4#, is around thirty years of age. Though he is clumsy, sweaty, and has unrefined interests like muscle building, #X_3# is more sensitive and more gentlemanly than #X_4# and his other friends, perhaps because he lives with his mother, who is slowly dying. #X_2# and #X_3# are an unlikely match: #X_3# doesn’t fit the bill of the chivalric hero, the man #X_2# dreams will come to rescue her. Nevertheless, they bond over their lost loves, and when the doctor takes #X_2# away against her will, #X_3# is the only person present besides #X_5# who despairs over the tragedy.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s friend, upstairs neighbor, and landlady. #X_0# and her husband, #X_4#, represent the low-class, carnal life that #X_3# has chosen for herself. Like #X_3#, #X_0# accepts her husband’s affections despite his physical abuse of her. At the end of the play, when #X_3# hesitates to stay with #X_2# at #X_1#’s expense, #X_0# forbids #X_3# to question her decision and tells her she has no choice but to disbelieve #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The young man with poetic aspirations whom #X_1# fell in love with and married as a teenager. One afternoon, she discovered #X_0# in bed with an older male friend. That evening at a ball, after she announced her disgust at his homosexuality, he ran outside and shot himself in the head. #X_0#’s death, which marked the end of #X_1#’s sexual innocence, has haunted her ever since. Long dead by the time of the play’s action, #X_0# never appears onstage.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# teenager who comes to the #X_3#’ door to collect for the newspaper when #X_2# is home alone. The boy leaves bewildered after #X_2# hits on him and gives him a passionate farewell kiss. He embodies #X_2#’s obsession with youth and presumably reminds her of her teenage love, the young poet #X_0#llan Grey, whom she married and lost to suicide. #X_2#’s flirtation with the newspaper collector also displays her unhealthy sexual preoccupation with teenage boys, which we learn of later in the play.

-- #X_0# --
A former suitor of #X_1#’s whom she met again a year before her arrival in #Y_1# while vacationing in #Y_0#. Despite the fact that #X_0# is married, #X_1# hopes he will provide the financial support for her and #X_3# to escape from #X_2#.

#X_2#’s poker buddy. Like #X_2# and #X_3#, #X_3# is physically fit and brutish. #X_0# is Hispanic, and his friendship with #X_3#, #X_2#, and #X_1# emphasizes the culturally diverse nature of their neighborhood.

-- #X_0# --
In Scene One, the unnamed #X_0# woman is sitting on the steps talking to #X_2# when #X_1# arrives, and she finds #X_3#’s openly sexual gestures toward #X_4# hilarious. Later, in Scene Ten, we see her scurrying across the stage in the night as she rifles through a prostitute’s lost handbag.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#t the play’s finale, the doctor arrives to whisk #X_1# off to an asylum. He and the nurse initially seem to be heartless institutional caretakers, but, in the end, the doctor appears more kindly as he takes off his jacket and leads #X_1# away. This image of the doctor ironically conforms to #X_1#’s notions of the chivalric Southern gentleman who will offer her salvation.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# vendor of #X_0# funeral decorations who frightens #Y_0# by issuing the plaintive call “Flores para los muertos,” which means “Flowers for the dead.”

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s main protagonist. #X_0# is a consulting detective who uses the science of deductive reasoning to solve criminal cases. He is excitable, intense, arrogant, and immensely intelligent, but almost nothing is known about his personal life. #X_0# is motivated by a desire to learn about things and explain how they work and how they came to be. Though his methods often confound observers, his ability to create a story from a scarcity of facts never ceases to astonish.

-- #X_0# --

The narrator and protagonist of the novel. #X_0# is an American veteran of World War I working as a journalist in #Y_0#, where he and his friends engage in an endless round of drinking and parties. Although #X_0# is the most stable of his friends, he struggles with anguish over his love for Lady #X_1#, his impotence, and the moral vacuum that resulted from the war. #X_0# positions himself as an observer, generally using his insight and intelligence to describe only those around him, rarely speaking directly about himself. However, in describing the events and people he sees, #X_0# implicitly reveals much about his own thoughts and feelings.

-- #X_0# --
A beautiful British socialite who drinks heavily. As the novel begins, #X_0# is separated from her husband and awaiting a divorce. Though she loves #X_2#, she is unwilling to commit to a relationship with him because it will mean giving up sex. Indeed, she is unwilling to commit fully to any of the many men who become infatuated with her, though she has affairs with a number of them. However, she does not seem to draw much happiness from her independence. Her life, like the lives of many in her generation, is aimless and unfulfilling.

-- #X_0# --
A wealthy American writer living in #Y_0#. Though he is an expatriate like many of his acquaintances, #X_0# stands apart because he had no direct experience of World War I and because he is Jewish. He holds on to the romantic prewar ideals of love and fair play, yet, against the backdrop of the devastating legacy of World War I, these values seem tragically absurd. As a Jew and a nonveteran, #X_0# is a convenient target for the cruel and petty antagonism of #X_1# and his friends.

-- #X_0# --
Like #X_1#, a heavy-drinking war veteran, though not an expatriate. #X_0# uses humor to deal with the emotional and psychological fallout of World War I. He and #X_1#, as American veterans, share a strong bond, and their friendship is one of the few genuine emotional connections in the novel. However, #X_0# is not immune to the petty cruelty that characterizes #X_1# and #X_1#’s circle of friends.

-- #X_0# --
A constantly drunk, bankrupt Scottish war veteran. #X_0# has a terrible temper, which most often manifests itself during his extremely frequent bouts of drunkenness.

-- #X_0# --
A beautiful, nineteen-year-old bullfighter. #X_0#’s talents in the ring charm both aficionados and newcomers to the sport alike. He serves as a foil (a character whose attitudes or emotions contrast with, and thereby accentuate, those of another character) for #X_1# and his friends in that he carries himself with dignity and confidence at all times. Moreover, his passion for bullfighting gives his life meaning and purpose. In a world of amorality and corrupted masculinity, #X_0# remains a figure of honesty, purity, and strength.

-- #X_0# --
The owner of a #Y_0# inn and a bullfighting expert. #X_0# sees bullfighting as something sacred, and he respects and admires #X_2# for his genuine enthusiasm about it. #X_0# takes a paternal interest in the gifted young bullfighter #X_3# and seeks to protect him from the corrupting influences of tourists and fame.

-- #X_0# --
A wealthy Greek count and a veteran of seven wars and four revolutions. #X_0# becomes infatuated with #X_2#, but, unlike most of #X_2#’s lovers, he does not subject her to jealous, controlling behavior.

-- #X_0# --
A British war veteran whom #X_4# and #X_2# befriend while fishing in #Y_0#. The three men share a profound common bond, having all experienced the horrors of World War I, as well as the intimacy that soldiers develop. #X_3#, as #X_4# and #X_2# call him, is a kind, friendly person who greatly values the brief time he spends with #X_4# and #X_2#.

He seems to symbolize the entire Lost Generation in that he feels out of place and purposeless in his later adult life.

-- #X_0# --
A drunken expatriate gambler who is perpetually out of money. #X_0# is intelligent and well read, yet he cannot escape his demons of excessive drinking and gambling. Like many of #X_2#’s friends, he is prone to petty cruelty toward #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A collections officer for #Y_0# and protagonist of the story. #X_0# is short, balding, and seemingly unremarkable.

-- #X_0# --
A giant talking frog. #X_0# enlists #X_1# to help him battle #X_2# to save #Y_0# from a giant earthquake. #X_0# has a deeply philosophical temperament, both in the sense that he enjoys knotty philosophical puzzles and that he is thoughtful, careful, and articulate. Even though #X_0# takes pains to prove that he is an actual frog, it remains unclear whether he truly exists.

-- #X_0# --
A giant worm that slumbers deep beneath #Y_1# city, directly under the offices of #Y_0#’s bank. #X_0# absorbs vibrations from the city, which slowly build up in his body until they are transformed into pure rage. When the rage reaches a critical point, #X_0# releases that energy in the form of devastating earthquakes.

-- #X_0# --
A woman who tends #X_2# in the hospital after he is found passed out in the street. She is patient and motherly and treats #X_2# with great sympathy.

-- #X_0# --
The man who shoots #X_2# shortly before he’s supposed to battle #X_3#. Because #X_2# shows no signs of having been wounded, it seems likely that the young man is a figment of #X_2#’s imagination.

-- #X_0# --
An attorney for #Y_0# Trading, a company that had been defaulting on loan payments to #X_1#’s bank. After #Y_2# pays a mysterious visit to the company leaders, #X_0# is dispatched to tell #X_1# that #Y_0# will pay its debt as long as #Y_2# is kept away.

-- #X_0# --
The psychologically abusive and womanizing husband of #X_2#. #X_0# is a communications teacher who loves baseball. He is an amateur filmmaker composing a film with #X_3# called Random Samples. #X_0#’s constant joking and imitation of cartoon characters serves as a poor cover for his selfish and sexist behavior, and the manner in which he communicates with #X_2# is deeply cruel. #X_0# is staunchly anti-American, yet he possesses all of the awful qualities that the narrator associates with Americans.

-- #X_0# --
The vulnerable yet sly wife of #X_1#. #X_0# puts on a veneer of sweetness in order to please her husband. She constantly sings and applies makeup.

She is more talkative and social than the narrator but far less introspective or self-aware.

-- #X_0# --
The compassionate yet reserved best friend of the narrator’s father. #X_0# is the first one to inform the narrator of her father’s disappearance.

He suffers from nervous ailments and longs for the nightly comfort of his mother's kiss. He is fascinated by art and becomes an avid reader and lover of architecture, theater, painting and music. He loves to walk around #Y_0# by himself and admire the stunning hawthorn blossoms that inspire him to become a writer.

A wealthy stockbroker, he becomes an expert art critic and dealer. #X_0# is also a womanizer who does not see women for who they really are, but instead compares them to paintings in order to make them more attractive. This tendency leads him to fall hopelessly in love with #X_2# even though she is not his "type." #X_0#'s idealization of #X_2# keeps him from seeing her as she really is, to the point that his love for her becomes a tragic form of vanity and self-love.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s great aunt. She is convinced that she will die at any moment and tries to get as much sympathy as possible for her various "ailments."

-- #X_0# --
One of Aunt #X_1#'s few remaining friends. #X_0# visits Aunt #X_1# each Sunday to gossip about the townspeople.

-- #X_0# --
The composer of #X_3# and #X_2#'s favorite sonata, which becomes the theme music of #X_3#'s love. This sonata has the power to conjure up #X_3#'s feelings for #X_2# even when he tries not to think of her. The sorrow and despair that #X_0# expresses in this sonata about the lesbian love affair of his daughter, Mademoiselle #X_0#, come to stand for #X_3#'s sufferings as well.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of #X_0#. She breaks her father's heart when she begins a sordid affair with another woman. She insults her father shortly after his death.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
A French aristocrat by birth, #X_0# chooses to live in #Y_0# because he cannot bear to be associated with the cruel injustices of the French social system. #X_0# displays great virtue in his rejection of the snobbish and cruel values of his uncle, the Marquis #X_1#. He exhibits an admirable honesty in his decision to reveal to Doctor #X_3# his true identity as a member of the infamous #X_1# family. So, too, does he prove his courage in his decision to return to #Y_1# at great personal risk to save the imprisoned #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
An insolent, indifferent, and alcoholic attorney who works with #Y_0#. #X_0# has no real prospects in life and doesn’t seem to be in pursuit of any. He does, however, love #X_3#, and his feelings for her eventually transform him into a man of profound merit.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s father and a brilliant physician, #X_0# spent eighteen years as a prisoner in the #Y_0#. At the start of the novel, #X_0# does nothing but make shoes, a hobby that he adopted to distract himself from the tortures of prison. As he overcomes his past as a prisoner, however, he proves to be a kind, loving father who prizes his daughter’s happiness above all things.

-- #X_0# --
A young French woman who grew up in #Y_0#, #X_0# was raised as a ward of #Y_1# because her parents were assumed dead. #X_1# depicts #X_0# as an archetype of compassion. Her love has the power to bind her family together—the text often refers to her as the “golden thread.” Furthermore, her love has the power to transform those around her. It enables her father to be “recalled to life,” and it sparks #X_2# development from a “jackal” into a hero.

-- #X_0# --
A wine shop owner and revolutionary in the poor Saint Antoine section of #Y_0#, #X_0# formerly worked as a servant for Doctor #X_1#. #X_0# proves an intelligent and committed revolutionary, a natural leader. Although he remains dedicated to bringing about a better society at any cost, he does demonstrate a kindness toward #X_1#. His wife, Madame #X_0#, views this consideration for #X_1# as a weakness.

-- #X_0# --
A cruel revolutionary whose hatred of the aristocracy fuels her tireless crusade, #X_0# spends a good deal of the novel knitting a register of everyone who must die for the revolutionary cause. Unlike her husband, she proves unrelentingly blood-thirsty, and her lust for vengeance knows no bounds.

-- #X_0# --
An elderly businessman who works for #Y_0#, Mr. #X_0# is a very business-oriented bachelor with a strong moral sense and a good, honest heart. He proves trustworthy and loyal, and Doctor #X_2# and #X_1# come to value him as a personal friend.

-- #X_0# --
An odd-job man for #Y_0#, #X_0# is gruff, short-tempered, superstitious, and uneducated. He supplements his income by working as a “Resurrection-Man,” one who digs up dead bodies and sells them to scientists.

-- #X_0# --
The servant who raised #X_2#, #X_0# is brusque, tough, and fiercely loyal to her mistress. Because she personifies order and loyalty, she provides the perfect foil to Madame #X_1#, who epitomizes the violent chaos of the revolution.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
Like #X_1#, #X_0# is a British spy who swears that patriotism alone inspires all of his actions. #X_0# feigns honesty but in fact constantly participates in conniving schemes.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The “shrew” of the play’s title, #X_0#, or #X_3#, is the daughter of #X_1#, with whom she lives in #Y_0#. She is sharp-tongued, quick-tempered, and prone to violence, particularly against anyone who tries to marry her. Her hostility toward suitors particularly distresses her father. But her anger and rudeness disguise her deep-seated sense of insecurity and her jealousy toward her sister, #X_2#. She does not resist her suitor #X_4# forever, though, and she eventually subjugates herself to him, despite her previous repudiation of marriage.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a gentleman from #Y_1#. Loud, boisterous, eccentric, quick-witted, and frequently drunk, he has come to #Y_0# “to wive and thrive.” He wishes for nothing more than a woman with an enormous dowry, and he finds #X_1# to be the perfect fit. Disregarding everyone who warns him of her shrewishness, he eventually succeeds not only in wooing #X_2#, but in silencing her tongue and temper with his own.

-- #X_0# --
The younger daughter of #X_1#. The lovely #X_0# proves herself the opposite of her sister, #X_2#, at the beginning of the play: she is soft-spoken, sweet, and unassuming. Thus, she operates as #X_2#’s principal female foil. Because of her large dowry and her mild behavior, several men vie for her hand. #X_1#, however, will not let her marry until #X_2# is wed.

-- #X_0# --
Minola #X_0# is one of the wealthiest men in #Y_0#, and his daughters become the prey of many suitors due to the substantial dowries he can offer. He is good-natured, if a bit superficial. His absentmindedness increases when #X_2# shows her obstinate nature. Thus, at the opening of the play, he is already desperate to find her a suitor, having decided that she must marry before #X_1# does.

-- #X_0# --
A young student from #Y_1#, the good-natured and intrepid #X_0# comes to #Y_0# to study at the city’s renowned university, but he is immediately sidetracked when he falls in love with #X_3# at first sight. By disguising himself as a classics instructor named #X_4#, he convinces #X_5# to offer him to #X_2# as a tutor for #X_3#. He wins her love, but his impersonation gets him into trouble when his father, #X_6#, visits #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s servant. #X_0# accompanies #X_3# from #Y_0#. Wry and comical, he plays an important part in his master’s charade—he assumes #X_3#’s identity and bargains with #X_1# for #X_2#’s hand.

-- #X_0# --
Two gentlemen of #Y_0#. #X_0# are #X_1#’s suitors at the beginning of the play. Though they are rivals, these older men also become friends during their mutual frustration with and rejection by #X_1#. #X_0# directs #X_4# to #X_2# and then dresses up as a music instructor to court #X_1#. He and #X_0# are both thwarted in their efforts by #X_3#. #X_0# ends up marrying a widow.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s servant and the fool of the play—a source of much comic relief.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s second servant, who assists his master and #X_2# in carrying out their plot.

-- #X_0# --
The principal character in the play’s brief Induction, #X_0# is a drunken tinker, tricked by a mischievous nobleman into thinking that he is really a lord.

-- #X_0# --
The play’s protagonist, and father of #X_4#. Twelve years before the events of the play, #X_0# was the duke of #Y_0#. His brother, #X_2#, in concert with #X_1#, king of #Y_1#, usurped him, forcing him to flee in a boat with his daughter. The honest lord #X_3# aided #X_0# in his escape. #X_0# has spent his twelve years on the island refining the magic that gives him the power he needs to punish and forgive his enemies.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of #X_2#, #X_0# was brought to the island at an early age and has never seen any men other than her father and #X_1#, though she dimly remembers being cared for by female servants as an infant. Because she has been sealed off from the world for so long, #X_0#’s perceptions of other people tend to be naïve and non-judgmental. She is compassionate, generous, and loyal to her father.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s spirit helper. #X_0# is referred to throughout this SparkNote and in most criticism as “he,” but his gender and physical form are ambiguous. Rescued by #X_1# from a long imprisonment at the hands of the witch #X_2#, #X_0# is #X_1#’s servant until #X_1# decides to release him. He is mischievous and ubiquitous, able to traverse the length of the island in an instant and to change shapes at will. He carries out virtually every task that #X_1# needs accomplished in the play.

-- #X_0# --
Another of #X_1#’s servants. #X_0#, the son of the now-deceased witch Sycorax, acquainted #X_1# with the island when #X_1# arrived. #X_0# believes that the island rightfully belongs to him and has been stolen by #X_1#. His speech and behavior is sometimes coarse and brutal, as in his drunken scenes with #X_2# and #X_3# (II.ii, IV.i), and sometimes eloquent and sensitive, as in his rebukes of #X_1# in Act I, scene ii, and in his description of the eerie beauty of the island in Act III, scene ii (III.ii.130-138).

-- #X_0# --
Son and heir of #X_1#. #X_0# seems in some ways to be as pure and naïve as #X_2#. He falls in love with her upon first sight and happily submits to servitude in order to win her father’s approval.

-- #X_0# --
King of #Y_1# and father of #X_2#. #X_0# aided #X_1# in unseating #X_3# as Duke of #Y_0# twelve years before. As he appears in the play, however, he is acutely aware of the consequences of all his actions. He blames his decision to marry his daughter to #X_4# on the apparent death of his son. In addition, after the magical banquet, he regrets his role in the usurping of #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s brother. #X_0# quickly demonstrates that he is power-hungry and foolish. In Act II, scene i, he persuades #X_4# to kill the sleeping #X_1#. He then goes along with #X_4#’s absurd story about fending off lions when #X_2# wakes up and catches #X_0# and #X_4# with their swords drawn.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s brother. Like #X_2#, he is both aggressive and cowardly. He is easily persuaded to kill his brother in Act II, scene i, and he initiates the ridiculous story about lions when #X_3# catches him with his sword drawn.

-- #X_0# --
An old, honest lord, #X_0# helped Prospero and #X_4# to escape after #X_3# usurped Prospero’s title. #X_0#’s speeches provide an important commentary on the events of the play, as he remarks on the beauty of the island when the stranded party first lands, then on the desperation of #X_2# after the magic banquet, and on the miracle of the reconciliation in Act V, scene i.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, a jester, and #X_0#, a drunken butler, are two minor members of the shipwrecked party. They provide a comic foil to the other, more powerful pairs of #X_3# and #X_1# and #X_2# and #X_4#. Their drunken boasting and petty greed reflect and deflate the quarrels and power struggles of #X_3# and the other noblemen.

-- #X_0# --
Appearing only in the first and last scenes, the #X_0# is vigorously good-natured. He seems competent and almost cheerful in the shipwreck scene, demanding practical help rather than weeping and praying. And he seems surprised but not stunned when he awakens from a long sleep at the end of the play.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
The novel’s protagonist. #X_0# is a beautiful, loyal young woman living with her impoverished family in the village of #Y_0#. #X_0# has a keen sense of responsibility and is committed to doing the best she can for her family, although her inexperience and lack of wise parenting leave her extremely vulnerable. Her life is complicated when her father discovers a link to the noble line of the #X_4#s, and, as a result, #X_0# is sent to work at the #X_4# mansion. Unfortunately, her ideals cannot prevent her from sliding further and further into misfortune after she becomes pregnant by #X_1# #X_4#. The terrible irony is that #X_0# and her family are not really related to this branch of the #X_4#s at all: #X_1#’s father, a merchant named #X_3#, simply assumed the name after he retired.

-- #X_0# --
An intelligent young man who has decided to become a farmer to preserve his intellectual freedom from the pressures of city life. #X_0#’s father and his two brothers are respected clergymen, but #X_0#’s religious doubts have kept him from joining the ministry. He meets #X_1# when she is a milkmaid at #Y_0# and quickly falls in love with her.

-- #X_0# --
The handsome, amoral son of a wealthy merchant named #X_1#. #X_0# is not really a #X_0#—his father simply took on the name of the ancient noble family after he built his mansion and retired. #X_0# is a manipulative, sinister young man who does everything he can to seduce the inexperienced #X_2# when she comes to work for his family. When he finally has his way with her, out in the woods, he subsequently tries to help her but is unable to make her love him.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s mother. #X_0# has a strong sense of propriety and very particular hopes for #X_2#’s life. She is continually disappointed and hurt by the way in which her daughter’s life actually proceeds. But she is also somewhat simpleminded and naturally forgiving, and she is unable to remain angry with #X_2#—particularly once #X_2# becomes her primary means  of support.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s mother, and the widow of #X_3#. #X_0# is blind and often ill. She cares deeply for her animals, but not for her maid #X_2#, her son #X_1#, nor #X_4# when she comes to work for her. In fact, she never sees #X_4# as anything more than an impoverished girl.

-- #X_0# --
Milkmaids whom #X_5# befriends at #Y_2#. #X_0# #X_0#, and #X_0# remain close to #X_5# throughout the rest of her life. They are all in love with #X_1# and are devastated when he chooses #X_5# over them: #X_3# turns to drink, #X_0# attempts suicide, and #X_0# nearly runs off to #Y_0# with #X_1# when he leaves #X_5#. Nevertheless, they remain helpful to #X_5#. #X_3# helps her find a job at a farm called #Y_1#, and #X_3# and #X_0# write #X_1# a plaintive letter encouraging him to give #X_5# another chance.

Unnamed. #X_0#, who also turns out to be #X_1#’s #X_0#, appears briefly at the end of the novel. Though she remains unnamed, in his keynote address for a #Y_0# symposium in the year 2197, Professor #X_3# speculates that she might be the same woman who recorded the tapes known collectively as “The Handmaid’s Tale.”

-- #X_0# --

He speaks about the authenticity of “The Ardua Hall Holograph” as well as the transcripts of the two testimonies given by #X_1# (Witness 369A) and #X_2# (Witness 369B).

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the novel. #X_0# defies categorization: she is black but flaunts her Caucasian-like straight hair, which comes from her mixed ancestry; she is a woman but defies gender stereotypes by insisting on her independence and wearing overalls. Behind her defiance are a curiosity and confidence that drive her to experience the world and become conscious of her relation to it. Part of #X_0#’s maturity rests in her ability to realize that others’ cruelty toward her or their inability to understand her stems not from malice but from their upbringing or limited perspective.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s third husband and first real love. Twelve years younger than #X_2#, #X_0# impresses her with his quick wit and zest for living. But behind the flash, he has a real affection for, and understanding of, #X_2#. He doesn’t try to force #X_2# to be anything other than herself, and he treats her with respect. He is not without faults, however; he does steal from her once and beat her. These reprehensible incidents, though, make him a more real character than one who possesses only idealized positive qualities.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s second husband. Joe #X_0#—or #X_0#, as #X_2# calls him—travels from #Y_1# to #Y_0# to satisfy his ambition and hunger for power. A consummate politician and businessman, he becomes the postmaster, mayor, storekeeper, and biggest landlord in #Y_0#. But he treats #X_2# as an object rather than a person, and their marriage deteriorates.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s first husband. #X_4# arranges #X_2#’s marriage to #X_0# because she values financial security and respectability over love. #X_0# pampers #X_2# for a year before he tries to make her help him with the farming work. Feeling used and unloved, #X_2# leaves him for #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s best friend in #Y_0#. #X_0# gives #X_1# the benefit of the doubt when the townspeople gossip viciously about #X_1#. She is the audience for #X_1#’s story and her presence is occasionally felt in the colloquial speech that the narrator mixes in with a more sophisticated narrative style.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s grandmother. #X_0#’s experience as a slave stamped her worldview with a strong concern for financial security, respectability, and upward mobility. These values clash with #X_2#’s independence and desire to experience the world, though #X_2# comes to respect #X_0#’s values and decisions as well intended.

-- #X_0# --
Everglades residents who run a small restaurant. #X_0# #X_0# prides herself on her Caucasian features and disdains anyone with a more African appearance. She worships #X_1# because of her Caucasian features. She cannot understand why a woman like #X_1# would marry a man as dark as #X_2#, and she wants to introduce #X_1# to her brother.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s husband. #X_0# is a source of great humor and wisdom during the conversations on #X_1#’s porch. When a few #Y_0# residents begin to express their resentment toward #X_1#, #X_0# acknowledges that #X_1# can be overbearing and commanding but points out that #X_1# is responsible for many improvements in the town.

-- #X_0# --
An influential clan leader in #Y_0#. Since early childhood, #X_0#’s embarrassment about his lazy, squandering, and effeminate father, #X_2#, has driven him to succeed. #X_0#’s hard work and prowess in war have earned him a position of high status in his clan, and he attains wealth sufficient to support three wives and their children. #X_0#’s tragic flaw is that he is terrified of looking weak like his father. As a result, he behaves rashly, bringing a great deal of trouble and sorrow upon himself and his family.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s oldest son, whom #X_2# believes is weak and lazy. #X_2# continually beats #X_0#, hoping to correct the faults that he perceives in him. Influenced by #X_1#, #X_0# begins to exhibit more masculine behavior, which pleases #X_2#. However, he maintains doubts about some of the laws and rules of his tribe and eventually converts to Christianity, an act that #X_2# criticizes as “effeminate.” #X_2# believes that #X_0# is afflicted with the same weaknesses that his father, #X_3#, possessed in abundance.

-- #X_0# --
The only child of #X_2#’s second wife, #X_1#. As the only one of #X_1#’s ten children to survive past infancy, #X_0# is the center of her mother’s world. Their relationship is atypical—#X_0# calls #X_1# by her name and is treated by her as an equal. #X_0# is also #X_2#’s favorite child, for she understands him better than any of his other children and reminds him of #X_1# when #X_1# was the village beauty. #X_2# rarely demonstrates his affection, however, because he fears that doing so would make him look weak. Furthermore, he wishes that #X_0# were a boy because she would have been the perfect son.

-- #X_0# --
A boy given to #X_2# by a neighboring village. #X_0# lives in the hut of #X_2#’s first wife and quickly becomes popular with #X_2#’s children. He develops an especially close relationship with #X_1#, #X_2#’s oldest son, who looks up to him. #X_2# too becomes very fond of #X_0#, who calls him “father” and is a perfect clansman, but #X_2# does not demonstrate his affection because he fears that doing so would make him look weak.

-- #X_0# --
The first white missionary to travel to #Y_0#. #X_0# institutes a policy of compromise, understanding, and non-aggression between his flock and the clan. He even becomes friends with prominent clansmen and builds a school and a hospital in #Y_0#. Unlike Reverend #X_1#, he attempts to appeal respectfully to the tribe’s value system rather than harshly impose his religion on it.

-- #X_0# --
The missionary who replaces Mr. #X_2#. Unlike Mr. #X_2#, #X_0# #X_0# is uncompromising and strict. He demands that his converts reject all of their indigenous beliefs, and he shows no respect for indigenous customs or culture. He is the stereotypical white colonialist, and his behavior epitomizes the problems of colonialism. He intentionally provokes his congregation, inciting it to anger and even indirectly, through #X_3#, encouraging some fairly serious transgressions.

-- #X_0# --
The younger brother of #X_1#’s mother. #X_0# receives #X_1# and his family warmly when they travel to #Y_0#, and he advises #X_1# to be grateful for the comfort that his motherland offers him lest he anger the dead—especially his mother, who is buried there. #X_0# himself has suffered—all but one of his six wives are dead and he has buried twenty-two children. He is a peaceful, compromising man and functions as a foil (a character whose emotions or actions highlight, by means of contrast, the emotions or actions of another character) to #X_1#, who acts impetuously and without thinking.

-- #X_0# --
An authority figure in the white colonial government in #Y_0#. #X_0# prototypical racist colonialist, the #X_0# #X_0# thinks that he understands everything about native African customs and cultures and he has no respect for them. He plans to work his experiences into an ethnographic study on local African tribes, the idea of which embodies his dehumanizing and reductive attitude toward race relations.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s father, of whom #X_1# has been ashamed since childhood. By the standards of the clan, #X_0# was a coward and a spendthrift. He never took a title in his life, he borrowed money from his clansmen, and he rarely repaid his debts. He never became a warrior because he feared the sight of blood. Moreover, he died of an abominable illness. On the positive side, #X_0# appears to have been a talented musician and gentle, if idle. He may well have been a dreamer, ill-suited to the chauvinistic culture into which he was born. The novel opens ten years after his death.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s close friend, whose daughter’s wedding provides cause for festivity early in the novel. #X_0# looks out for his friend, selling #X_2#’s yams to ensure that #X_2# won’t suffer financial ruin while in exile and comforting #X_2# when he is depressed. Like #X_1#, #X_0# questions some of the tribe’s traditional strictures.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#’s second wife, once the village beauty. #X_0# ran away from her first husband to live with #X_4#. #X_3# is her only surviving child, her other nine having died in infancy, and #X_0# constantly fears that she will lose #X_3# as well. #X_0# is good friends with #X_2#, the priestess of the goddess #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A fanatical convert to the Christian church in #Y_0#. #X_0#’s disrespectful act of ripping the mask off an egwugwu during an annual ceremony to honor the earth deity leads to the climactic clash between the indigenous and colonial justice systems. While Mr. #X_1#, early on, keeps #X_0# in check in the interest of community harmony, Reverend #X_2# approves of his zealotry.

-- #X_0# --
The oldest man in the village and one of the most important clan elders and leaders. #X_0# was a great warrior in his youth and now delivers messages from the Oracle.

-- #X_0# --
A priestess in #Y_0# who is dedicated to the Oracle of the goddess Agbala. #X_0# is a widow with two children. She is good friends with #X_1# and is fond of #X_2#, whom she calls “my daughter.” At one point, she carries #X_2# on her back for miles in order to help purify her and appease the gods.

-- #X_0# --
A clan leader of Umuofia. #X_0# and Mr. #X_1# discuss their religious beliefs peacefully, and #X_0#’s influence on the missionary advances Mr. #X_1#’s strategy for converting the largest number of clansmen by working with, rather than against, their belief system. In so doing, however, #X_0# formulates an articulate and rational defense of his religious system and draws some striking parallels between his style of worship and that of the Christian missionaries.

-- #X_0# --
A wealthy clansmen who takes a chance on #X_1# by lending him 800 seed yams—twice the number for which #X_1# asks. #X_0# thereby helps #X_1# build up the beginnings of his personal wealth, status, and independence.

-- #X_0# --
The native-turned-Christian missionary who arrives in #Y_0# and converts #X_1# and many others.

-- #X_0# --
A famous medicine man whom #X_2# summons for help in dealing with #X_1#’s health problems.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s son. #X_0# wins a wrestling contest in his mid-teens. #X_2# wishes he had promising, manly sons like #X_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The daughter of #X_2#’s first wife. Although #X_0# is close to #X_1# in age, #X_1# has a great deal of influence over her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s third and youngest wife, and the mother of #X_1#. #X_2# beats #X_0# during the Week of Peace.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator and protagonist of the collection of stories. #X_0# is a pacifist who rationalizes his participation in #Y_0# by concluding that his feelings of obligation toward his family and country are stronger influences than his own politics. When the war is over, he uses his ability to tell stories to deal with his guilt and confusion over the atrocities he witnessed in #Y_0#, including the death of several of his fellow soldiers and of a Viet Cong soldier by his own hand.

-- #X_0# --
The lieutenant of the #Y_0#, who is responsible for the entire group of men. #X_0# is well intentioned but unsure of how to lead his men. He is wracked with guilt because he believes that his preoccupation with his unrequited love for a girl named #X_3# and his tendency to follow orders despite his better judgment caused the deaths of #X_4# and #X_2#, two members of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
One of the most likable soldiers in the war. #X_0# strongly influences the narrator, #X_1#. He is kind and devoted, and he has a strong sense of justice. Because of these qualities, he is a type of father figure. Though his ideas of storytelling may or may not agree with #X_1#’s in the end, his ability to tell stories and to discuss their nuances makes a profound impression on #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s closest friend and a model of quiet, rational morality amid the atrocities of war. #X_0#’s death, when the company mistakenly camps in a sewage field, is the focal point of three stories. Since it is a prime example of arbitrary, unforgiving cruelty in war, #X_0#’s death is given more prominence than his life.

-- #X_0# --
A man who embodies the damage that the war can do to a soldier long after the war is over. During the war, #X_0# is quiet and unassuming, and #X_1#’s death has a profound effect on him. #X_0#’s letter to #X_2# in “Notes” demonstrates the importance of sharing stories in the healing process.

-- #X_0# --
The proprietor of #Y_1# on the Rainy River near the Canadian border. #X_0# serves as the closest thing to a father figure for #X_1#, who, after receiving his draft notice, spends six contemplative days with the quiet, kind #X_0# while he makes a decision about whether to go to war or to escape the draft by running across the border to #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
Mark #X_2#’s high school sweetheart. Although #X_0# #X_0# arrives in #Y_0# full of innocence, she gains a respect for death and the darkness of the jungle and, according to legend, disappears there. Unlike #X_5# and #X_3#’s girlfriend, who only serve as fantasy reminders of a world removed from #Y_0#, #X_0# #X_0# is a strong and realized character who shatters #X_2#’s fantasy of finding comfort in his docile girlfriend.

-- #X_0# --
The platoon’s machine gunner and resident gentle giant. #X_0#’s profound decency, despite his simplicity, contrasts with his bearish frame. He is a perfect example of the incongruities in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The platoon’s medic. #X_0# previously served in the mountains of #Y_0#, the setting of “Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong.” #X_3# has great respect for #X_0#’s medical prowess, especially when he is shot for a second time and is subjected to the mistreatment of another medic, #X_0#by Jorgenson. Though levelheaded and kind, #X_0# eventually succumbs to the stresses of the war and his role in it—he purposely blows off his toe so that he is forced to leave his post.

-- #X_0# --
A childish and careless member of #Y_1# who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though #X_2# does not particularly like #X_0#, #X_0#’s death is something #X_2# continually contemplates with sadness and regret. The preventability of his death and the irrational fears of his life—as when a dentist visits the company—point to the immaturity of many young American soldiers in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A young, scared soldier in #Y_1#. #X_0# is the first to die in the work. He makes only a brief appearance in the narrative, popping tranquilizers to calm himself while the company is outside #Y_0#. Because his death, like #X_1#’s, is preventable, it illustrates the expendability of human life in a senseless war.

-- #X_0# --
Another soldier in the platoon and a minor character. A struggle with #X_1# over a jackknife results in #X_0#’s broken nose. In begging #X_2# to forget their pact—that if either man is gravely injured, the other will kill him swiftly—after he is injured, he illustrates how the fantasy of war differs from its reality.

-- #X_0# --
A minor character whose guilt over his injury of #X_2# causes him to break his own nose. #X_0#’s relief after #X_3#’s death is an illustration of the perspective soldiers are forced to assume. Instead of mourning the loss of his friend, #X_0# is glad to know that the pact the two made—and that he broke—has now become obsolete.

-- #X_0# --
A soldier in #Y_0# and one of the few unsympathetic characters in the work. Every time #X_0# appears, he is mean-spirited and cruel, torturing Vietnamese civilians and poking fun both at the corpses of the enemy and the deaths of his own fellow soldiers. His humanity is finally demonstrated near the end of the work, when he is forced to help unearth #X_2#’s body from the muck of the sewage field. This moment of remorse proves that a breaking point is possible even for soldiers who use cruelty as a defense mechanism.

-- #X_0# --
The medic who replaces #X_2#. The second time #X_1# is shot, #X_0#’s incompetence inspires #X_1#’s desire for irrational revenge. Although #X_0#’s anger prompts him to kick #X_1# in the head for trying to scare him, he later apologizes, redeeming himself as a medic by patching things up with #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s daughter and a symbol of the naïve outsider. Although #X_1# alludes to having multiple children, #X_0# is the only one we meet. Her youth and innocence force #X_1# to try to explain the meaning of the war. Frustrated that he cannot tell her the whole truth, he is inspired by her presence since it forces him to gain new perspective on his war experience.

-- #X_0# --
A medic in #X_2# previous assignment. #X_0# loses his innocence in the realization that his girlfriend, #X_1#, would rather be out on ambush with #Y_1# than planning her postwar wedding to #X_0# in #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s first love, whose death of a brain tumor in the fifth grade is #X_1#’s first experience with mortality. From his experience with #X_0#, #X_1# learns the power that storytelling has to keep memory alive.

-- #X_0# --
A new student in town and the female protagonist of the novel. #X_0# commits suicide before the novel begins, and she is present in the story only through recordings in which she narrates the reasons why she took her own life.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_1#’s and the male protagonist. #X_0# narrates the real-time events of the story while reflecting on what he learns from #X_1#’s tapes. #X_1# says that he does not belong on her list because of anything he’s done, but because she can’t tell her story without him.

Six years after their last meeting, he and #X_1# begin corresponding by mail. When #X_1# tells #X_0# of the abuse he endures in Chinook, #X_0# encourages #X_1# to apply to private schools on the east coast and arranges for them to meet during the summer.

#X_0# narrator, Mr. #X_2#, is the Time Traveller's dinner guest. His curiosity is enough to make him return to investigate the morning after the first time travel.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is one of the Eloi. Although #X_1# reports that it is difficult to distinguish gender among the Eloi, he seems quite sure that #X_0# is female. He easily saves her from being washed down the river, and she eagerly becomes his friend. Her behavior toward him is not unlike that of a pet or small child.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# of Athens is the title character in #X_1#'s #X_0# of Athens. Beginning the play as a wealthy man, #X_0# enjoys giving gifts to his friends and sharing his wealth. He believes that friendship means giving to his friends, without expecting something in return. #X_0#'s servants all await the day when #X_0#'s bounty runs out, for #X_0# has spent all of his money and more without listening to their reports about the status of his accounts. When creditors show up asking for payment on his debts, #X_0# finally listens, and discovers that he is bankrupt. He sends servants to his friends to ask for loans, but all come back empty-handed. Convinced all humanity has turned against him, #X_0# declares his hatred for mankind and takes off for the forest, where, to his dismay, he becomes a sought-after guru-like figure, and he discovers a hidden stash of gold. People constantly want to contact him, though his only discourse consists of curses for flatterers and false friends. #X_0# ends his days filled with bile at mankind.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is not one of #X_1#'s friends, but he attends #X_1#'s feasts anyway, looking for an opportunity to scorn Athenian citizens. He always scoffs at #X_1#'s greetings, promising he will never be polite to #X_1#'s friendly words. While #X_1#'s other friends receive gifts, #X_1# withholds them from #X_0# until he should choose to be more sociable. #X_0# thinks #X_1#'s friends are all flatterers and false money-grubbers. When #X_1#'s luck changes, and he leaves Athens, #X_0# is delighted, and follows #X_1# to the wilderness merely to remind him that his villainous friends refused to loan him money. The two insult each other heartily and seem to dislike each other, yet they form a curious bond. #X_0#'s poor upbringing makes him used to suffering while #X_1# is new to it, says #X_1#. But they are finally in the same boat, hating mankind together. Yet #X_1# still shoos him away from his forest home.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is an acquaintance of #X_1#, apparently a soldier. When one of his friends is sentenced to death by the Senators, #X_0# protests and is banished. He promises to raise an army and conquer #Y_0#. He encounters #X_1# in the woods after he has left #Y_0#, and offers to help him after he sacks #Y_0#. #X_1# enthusiastically supports the idea of destroying #Y_0#, and gives #X_0# a sum of gold to aid his army. So when #X_0# stands outside the gates of #Y_0#, he attempts to right both the wrongs done to him and those done to #X_1#, becoming his final champion after his death.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#'s servants, #X_0# is terrified to talk to #X_1# about his finances because #X_1# refuses to listen to him. #X_1# has not only run out of money, but he has gone into debt in order to continue giving gifts to his friends, and all his land is mortgaged. Finally #X_0# has to confront #X_1# with the facts. When #X_1# is unable to procure a loan from his friends, he leaves Athens, and #X_0# and his other servants mourn the fall of such a good man, brought down by his own generosity. #X_0# shares out his last cash among the remaining servants, and determines to continue to serve #X_1#, going into the wilderness after him. Upon finding #X_1#, he offers his last remaining gold and weeps at #X_1#'s downfall. Astonished, #X_1# declares #X_0# is the only honorable man he knew in Athens, the only man who escapes his cursings of mankind, and gives him a sum of gold as a reward.

One of #X_1#'s hangers-on, the #X_0#composes verses for pay when #X_1# is wealthy. The #X_0#goes to the wilderness to seek #X_1# after his fall, having heard #X_1# found gold and hoping to get into his good graces. #X_1# thinks he's a money-grubbing flatterer.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#'s hangers-on, the #X_0#paints #X_1#'s likeness for pay when #X_1# is wealthy. The #X_0#goes to the wilderness to seek #X_1# after his fall, having heard #X_1# found gold and hoping to get into his good graces. #X_1# thinks he's a money-grubbing flatterer.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#'s hangers-on, the #X_0#provides the ostentatious jewelry that #X_1# gives as gifts to his friends.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# appears with Apemantus outside Timon's house while servants of creditors wait for their payments. The #X_0# makes parallels between those who go to creditors and those who go to prostitutes. As is often the case in #X_1#, the #X_0# appears to be unconsciously wiser than most other characters.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# encounters these thieves in the wilderness, and he offers them gold to cause destruction and mayhem in #Y_0#. #X_1# speaks so enthusiastically of the damage he hopes they will cause that they are put off their own profession.

-- #X_0# --
Members of the Athenian Senate, the #X_0# judge Alcibiades's friend, and later seek to bring Timon back to Athens. They try to defend Athens from Alcibiades, explaining that not everyone in the city is a bad person, only a few select characters, who can be singled out and punished.

-- #X_0# --
Among Timon's many friends who attend his feasts and accept his gifts.

-- #X_0# --
General of Rome and tragic hero of the play. Father of Lavinia and Lucius. #X_0# has spent the last ten years fighting Rome's enemies and winning honor for his country, yet his heroic deeds have taken so much out of him that he feels incapable of leading his country despite its desire that he be its new emperor. He is first held up as a model of piety for his staunch reverence for traditions, but it is this strict adherence to tradition that causes his enemies to take revenge against him. A Senecan hero, he pursues revenge to the end, and dies in the process.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4# of the Goths, mother of #X_1# and #X_2#. Though her very first speech shows her to be a caring mother who has an appreciation of the nobility of mercy, #X_0#is associated with barbarism, savagery, and unrestrained lasciviousness. Indeed, #X_0#exhibits extreme ruthlessness, particularly when she encourages her sons to rape #X_3#, and says that she knows not the meaning of pity. Even though she is opposite in everything to the archetypal victim #X_3#, feminist theorists like to cast her in the position of a victim of a male law of order. In this light, she becomes the dartboard for misogynistic fear of sexual appetite.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s Moorish lover. #X_1# only created four other black characters before the tragic hero Othello, and #X_0#is the most substantial of the four. As he himself admits, there is not a crime in #X_3# in which he has not had a hand. He is practically the engine of action in Act II, bringing #X_2#'s dream of revenge to reality. This simplistic, depthless portraiture of evil is a descendant of the "Devil" or "Vice" from early Elizabethan morality plays, created only to move the audience to contempt. For that reason, there is little about #X_0#to win our sympathy or to even explain the motivation for his evil. His protectiveness of his child presents an interesting contrast in parenthood to #X_2# and #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The only daughter of Titus Andronicus, she spurns Saturninus's offer to make her his empress because she is in love with Bassianus. She is brutally raped and disfigured by Chiron and Demetrius in the forest during the hunt. Thereafter, she is a mute and horrifying presence constantly on stage, complement to her father's loquacious sufferings, and accomplice to his bloody vengeance. Deprived of every means of communication, and robbed of her most precious chastity, she comes across as one of Shakespeare's most incapacitated heroines. Yet, as she is physically pared down, her narrative and thematic importance escalates, drawing our attention to the importance of pantomime on the stage. The rape of #X_0# is undoubtedly the central and most horrific crime of the play, which is why #X_1# adaptation of the play has the alternate name of "The Rape of #X_0#." For this reason, her character invites especially careful scrutiny.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# of the People. Brother of Titus #X_0#. Unlike the other #X_1#, he never participates in the war. Where everyone else has had a hand in at least one murder or crime, he remains conspicuously removed from the bloodshed. Every time he speaks, he is the sound of reason and calmness, standing in stark contrast to the ravenous and crazed speeches of the other characters.

-- #X_0# --
The eldest son of the late Emperor of #Y_0#. #X_3# successfully advocates for him to be the new emperor. However, #X_0# shows no gratitude. He is impatient with the #X_1# and would rather have them out of his way; he feels threatened by the genuine honor and people's support that they have won for themselves. He chooses the captive #X_2#, Queen of the Goths, for his empress, thereby giving her the power to wreak havoc on #Y_0# and #X_3#'s family.

-- #X_0# --
The younger brother of Saturninus. It is to him that Lavinia is betrothed. He steals her away when Saturninus wants to make her his empress, which sets into motion the events that lead Titus to kill his own son, and Saturninus to despise the Andronici. He is murdered by Chiron and Demetrius, but Quintus and Martius are framed for his murder, which leads to their beheadings. As the representative of grace and virtue, his failure to become emperor in the first act is the sign of a degenerate #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
Titus's only surviving son. He defends his sister, Lavinia, from their father after she runs away with Bassianus. He tries to free his captive brothers Quintus and Martius, for which he is banished from Rome. The people of Rome support him over Saturninus. He is probably the one character to undergo a substantial psychological transformation over the course of the play, moving from bloodthirsty youth to sober leader.

-- #X_0# --
Two Goth princes. Sons of Tamora. They squabble over who loves Lavinia more, when really they are merely guided by lust. They murder Bassianus and then brutally rape and disfigure Lavinia. They are shown in this play to be nothing more than engines of lust, destruction, and depravity, empty of even the basic wit that makes #X_1# a more compelling villain. They are finally killed by Titus, who has their blood and bones made into a pastry to be fed to their mother.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator and protagonist of the story. Jean Louise “#X_0#” #X_0# lives with her father, #X_2#, her brother, #X_5#, and their black cook, #X_3#, in #Y_0#. She is intelligent and, by the standards of her time and place, a tomboy. #X_0# has a combative streak and a basic faith in the goodness of the people in her community. As the novel progresses, this faith is tested by the hatred and prejudice that emerge during #X_6# trial. #X_0# eventually develops a more grown-up perspective that enables her to appreciate human goodness without ignoring human evil.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# and #X_1#’s father, a lawyer in #Y_0# descended from an old local family. A widower with a dry sense of humor, #X_0# has instilled in his children his strong sense of morality and justice. He is one of the few residents of #Y_0# committed to racial equality. When he agrees to defend #X_3#, a black man charged with raping a white woman, he exposes himself and his family to the anger of the white community. With his strongly held convictions, wisdom, and empathy, #X_0# functions as the novel’s moral backbone.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s brother and constant playmate at the beginning of the story. Jeremy Atticus “#X_0#” #X_0# is something of a typical American boy, refusing to back down from dares and fantasizing about playing football. Four years older than #X_3#, he gradually separates himself from her games, but he remains her close companion and protector throughout the novel. #X_0# moves into adolescence during the story, and his ideals are shaken badly by the evil and injustice that he perceives during the trial of #X_4#.

-- #X_0# --
A recluse who never sets foot outside his house, #X_2# dominates the imaginations of #X_4#, #X_5#, and #X_3#. He is a powerful symbol of goodness swathed in an initial shroud of creepiness, leaving little presents for #X_5# and #X_4# and emerging at an opportune moment to save the children. An intelligent child emotionally damaged by his cruel father, #X_2# provides an example of the threat that evil poses to innocence and goodness. He is one of the novel’s “mockingbirds,” a good person injured by the evil of mankind.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_1#’ black cook. #X_0# is a stern disciplinarian and the children’s bridge between the white world and her own black community.

-- #X_0# --
A drunken, mostly unemployed member of #X_1#’s poorest family. In his knowingly wrongful accusation that #X_2# raped his daughter, #X_0# represents the dark side of the South: ignorance, poverty, squalor, and hate-filled racial prejudice.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4# and #X_5#’s summer neighbor and friend. #X_3# is a diminutive, confident boy with an active imagination. He becomes fascinated with #X_2# and represents the perspective of childhood innocence throughout the novel.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_3#’ neighbor, a sharp-tongued widow, and an old friend of the family. #X_0# #X_0# is almost the same age as #X_2#’s younger brother, #X_4#. She shares #X_2#’s passion for justice and is the children’s best friend among #X_5#’s adults.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s sister, a strong-willed woman with a fierce devotion to her family. #X_0# is the perfect Southern lady, and her commitment to propriety and tradition often leads her to clash with #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
Bob #X_0#’s abused, lonely, unhappy daughter. Though one can pity #X_0# because of her overbearing father, one cannot pardon her for her shameful indictment of #X_2#.

The black field hand accused of rape. #X_0# is one of the novel’s “mockingbirds,” an important symbol of innocence destroyed by evil.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# Robinson’s employer. In his willingness to look past race and praise the integrity of #X_2#’s character, #X_0# epitomizes the opposite of prejudice.

-- #X_0# --
An elderly, ill-tempered, racist woman who lives near the #X_3#. Although #X_4# believes that #X_0# #X_0# is a thoroughly bad woman, #X_2# admires her for the courage with which she battles her morphine addiction.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# #X_0#’s older brother. #X_4# thinks that #X_0# is similar to the deceased Mr. #X_0#, #X_1# and #X_0#’s father. #X_0# cruelly cuts off an important element of #X_1#’s relationship with #X_3# and #X_4# when he plugs up the knothole in which #X_1# leaves presents for the children.

Mr. #X_0#’s wife. A beautiful and loving woman, #X_0# is a wonderful hostess who takes pride in making memorable experiences for the guests at the family’s summer home on the Isle of Skye. Affirming traditional gender roles wholeheartedly, she lavishes particular attention on her male guests, who she believes have delicate egos and need constant support and sympathy. She is a dutiful and loving wife but often struggles with her husband’s difficult moods and selfishness. Without fail, however, she triumphs through these difficult times and demonstrates an ability to make something significant and lasting from the most ephemeral of circumstances, such as a dinner party.

-- #X_0# --
Mrs. #X_0#’s husband, and a prominent metaphysical philosopher. #X_0# loves his family but often acts like something of a tyrant. He tends to be selfish and harsh due to his persistent personal and professional anxieties. He fears, more than anything, that his work is insignificant in the grand scheme of things and that he will not be remembered by future generations. Well aware of how blessed he is to have such a wonderful family, he nevertheless tends to punish his wife, children, and guests by demanding their constant sympathy, attention, and support.

-- #X_0# --
A young, single painter who befriends the #X_2#s on the Isle of Skye. Like Mr. #X_2#, #X_0# is plagued by fears that her work lacks worth.

The opinions of men like #X_1#, who insists that women cannot paint or write, threaten to undermine her confidence.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0#s’ youngest son. #X_0# loves his mother deeply and feels a murderous antipathy toward his father, with whom he must compete for Mrs. #X_0#’s love and affection.

#X_2# Jones, a "bastard" raised by the philanthropic #X_0#, is the novel's  eponymous hero and protagonist. Although #X_2#'s faults (namely, his imprudence  and his lack of chastity) prevent him from being a perfect hero, his good heart  and generosity make him #X_1#'s avatar of #Y_0#, along with #X_0#. #X_2#'s  handsome face and gallantry win him the love and affection of women throughout  the countryside. His dignified, though natural air induces characters to assume  that he is a gentleman—which ultimately turns out to be true.

-- 
#X_2# #X_4# % 
 --
#X_2# #X_4# is #X_1#'s beautiful, generous heroine and the daughter of the  violent Squire #X_4#. Like #X_3#, #X_2# lavishes gifts on the poor, and she  treats people of all classes with such respect that one landlady cannot believe  she is a "gentlewoman." #X_2# manages to reconcile her love for #X_3#, her filial  duty to her father, and her hatred for #X_0# through her courage and patience.  #X_2#'s natural courtesy can be contrasted with her Aunt #X_4#'s artificial  manners.

-- 
Mr. #X_0# % 
 --
Mr. #X_0# is just what his name implies - all worthy. #X_0# has a  reputation throughout #Y_0# because of his benevolent, altruistic behavior.  The moral yardstick of the novel, #X_0#'s only fault (which ironically  propels much of the plot) is that—due to his goodness—he cannot  perceive the evil in others.

-- 
Master #X_0# 
 --
#X_0# is antagonist to #X_3# Jones and the son of #X_1# and Captain  #X_0#. Although he appears at first to be a virtuous character, his hypocrisy  soon exposes itself—#X_0# pretends to be pious and principled, but greed  governs him. The fact that #X_0# has few redeeming qualities makes #X_3#  compassion for him at the end of the novel—after the revelation that  #X_0# kept the secret of #X_3#'s birth to himself—even more commendable.  #X_0#'s dearth of natural human appetites—he at first does not desire  #X_2#—does not distinguish him as a virtuous character, but rather  provides a depressing picture of what humanity would be like if devoid of  passion.

-- 
#X_3# Western % 
 --
#X_3# Western is a caricature of the rough-and-ready, conservative country  gentleman. Affectionate at heart, the #X_3# nevertheless acts with extreme  violence towards his daughter #X_2#, by constantly incarcerating her, and even  verbally and physically abusing her. However, since the #X_3# is a caricature,  #X_1# does not intend for us to judge these actions too harshly. Similarly,  the #X_3#'s insistence on #X_2# marrying #X_0# has less to do with greed than  with his stubbornness and adherence to tradition. #X_3# Western's speaks in  West Country dialect, and peppers his speech with curses.

-- 
Mrs. #X_3# % 
 --
Mrs. #X_3#, the foil of her brother #X_2#, is a caricature of the  artificial city lady who always acts out of expediency. Mrs. #X_3# prides  herself on being adept at all intellectual pursuits—from politics to  philosophy to feminism to amour—yet her ignorance reveals itself on  numerous occasions (she thinks that #X_0# lectured to students instead of  engaging in conversational debate). Mrs. #X_3#'s sole aim in the novel is to  improve the #X_3# name by marrying off #X_1# to the richest, most prosperous  man she can find.

-- 
#X_4# 
 --
#X_4# is the teacher whom #X_0# accuses of being #X_6#'s father. He is a  kind of comedic #X_2# character (#X_1# even compares him to #X_2#).  Although pathetic, bumbling, and cowardly, #X_4# remains a loyal servant to  #X_3# and deserves his reward at the end of the novel. #X_4# has a passion  for speaking in Latin non sequiturs. Although #X_4# creates problems for #X_6#  and #X_5# by boosting #X_6#'s reputation and defiling #X_5#'s to all and sundry,  #X_6# cannot help forgiving #X_4#, who always has the best of intentions.

-- 
#X_1# Jones % 
 --
#X_1# Jones (Mrs. #X_7#) is the student of #X_4# whom #X_0# banishes  for being #X_6#'s mother—at the end of the novel we learn that #X_1# is not  #X_6#'s mother. #X_1# reappears as "Mrs. #X_7#" at #Y_0#, where #X_6# saves her  from a robbery. Although #X_1# does not possess the beauty of a #X_5#, her very  white breasts attract #X_6# to her. Although she protests to Mr. #X_0# at the  end of the novel that she has led a virtuous life, her seduction of #X_6# in #Y_0#  suggests otherwise. She eventually marries #X_3#, a friend of #Y_1#.

-- 
#X_1# Allworthy % 
 --
#X_1# Allworthy is the mother of #X_0# and #X_3#. An unattractive lady who  resents beautiful women, #X_1# marries Captain #X_0# because he flatters her  religious views. Although #X_1#'s affection wavers between #X_0# and #X_3# as  the boys mature, she becomes devoted to #X_3# before her death—largely due  to his good looks and gallantry.

-- 
Lady #X_0# 
 --
Lady #X_0# is a #Y_0# lady, and a relative of #X_1#, whose passionate,  lusty personality leads her to dabble in intrigues. The stem of her last name  "Bella-", meaning "war" in Latin, points to her malicious nature—she  thinks of no one but herself. Lady #X_0# carries out a vengeful battle  against #X_2# and #X_1# with the utmost glee.

-- 
Harriet #X_0# % 
 --
Harriet #X_0# is #X_2#'s cousin and the wife of Mr. #X_0#. Pretty  and charming, she is nevertheless selfish and contrives against #X_2# in order  to improve her relationship with Squire #X_3# and Mrs. #X_3#.

-- 
Mr. #X_0# % 
 --
Mr. #X_0# is a rash Irishman whom Harriet #X_0# casts in the light  of an ogre chasing her across the countryside. #X_0# becomes admirable,  however, when he admits to initiating the duel with #X_2# at the end of the novel.

-- 
Mr. #X_1# 
 --
Mr. #X_1# is a shrewd, shifty lawyer who becomes a friend of #Y_0#. Always  operating out of expediency, when #X_1# realizes that #Y_0# will not be able  to reward him for his efforts, he defects to #X_2# and #X_0#'s side.

-- 
Mrs. #X_2# 
 --
Mrs. #X_2# is a faithful friend to #X_4# and the most caring and concerned of  mothers to #X_3# and #X_1#. Feisty and active, Mrs. #X_2# carries through on  her promises and becomes #X_4#'s biggest advocate to #X_0#. She is trusting  and loyal.

-- 
#X_1# 
 --
#X_1#, although a foppish city gentleman, possesses the laudable traits of  loyalty and compassion—although not always in affairs of love. It takes a  little time for #X_2# to convince #X_1# not to abandon #X_0#, since  #X_1# is caught up in his image in #Y_0#. To his credit, #X_1#  transforms and follows #X_2#'s principles of Honour—that is, fulfilling  verbal commitments.

-- 
Lord #X_1# 
 --
Lord #X_1# is a suitor of #X_2# who, though he has a conscience, easily  allows himself to be manipulated by Lady #X_0#.

-- 
#Y_0# 
 --
#Y_0# is a philosopher who lives with #X_0#. He justifies his questionable  behavior (such as making love to #X_1#) by contorting his philosophical  notions. #Y_0#, although a foil to #Y_1#, is less sinister than the latter.  Indeed, #Y_0#'s virtuous transformation at the end of the novel allows  #X_0# to forgive #X_2#.

-- 
#X_1# 
 --
#X_1# is the vicious tutor of #X_0# and #X_2# who constantly beats #X_2# and  praises #X_0#. #X_1#, who claims to value Religion above all else, seeks  only his own good.

-- 
#X_1# Seagrim 
 --
#X_1# Seagrim is the rugged, unfeminine daughter of #X_0# who seduces  #X_3#. Feisty and aggressive, #X_1# enjoys the company of men, and fights fiercely  for her rights.

-- 
#X_0# 
 --
#X_0# is the servant who is favored by #X_2#. Although of dubious moral  tincture (#X_0# steals and lies), #X_0#'s loyalty to and love of  #X_2# nevertheless emerges.

-- 
Nancy #X_0# 
 --
Nancy #X_0# is the daughter of Mrs. #X_0# who becomes #X_2#'s wife.

-- 
Narrator  
 --
The ironic, intrusive narrator can be assumed to be #X_0# himself since he  reflects on his process of creating #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
Following #X_2#'s #Y_0# analogy, #X_0# would be king #X_1#. He is the protagonist of #Y_1# and the leader and father figure of the group of paisanos that the story focuses on. Being the owner of their house, he feels more responsibility then the rest for the well being of the group. He is twenty-five years old when he leaves for World War II.

-- #X_0# --
Every successful group has a thinker, and in the case of #X_1#'s friends, #X_0# is the thinker. When there is a difficult situation or a need, he is usually the one to find a solution. He is also a very spiritual person. Though he lives an unscrupulous life, #X_0# always tries to do what is right. He also has a surprising appreciation for the mystical beauty of nature.

-- #X_0# --
Though he is not a smart or righteous man, #X_0#demonstrates a keen insight for the messages that life tries to teach. He understands when to speak and when not to, and always seems to do the right thing, whether he understands it or not.

-- #X_0# --
Among the ruffians of #Y_0#, one would not expect to find a humanitarian, but that is just what #X_0# #X_0# is. Not only is he constantly doing all that he can to help those less fortunate than himself, but he has a knack for finding situations where his humanity can be put to use.

-- #X_0# --
Large, slow witted, lazy, and weak willed, #X_0# #X_0# is something of an anti-hero in #Y_0# yet he still manages to garner some sympathy from readers. He has to be pushed to do good things, but once he gets going, he is a force to be reckoned with. He often does bad things by accident, not really meaning harm, but just forgetting what he is supposed to do.

-- #X_0# --
Described as a man whose mind did not grow up with his body, the #X_0# is an odd addition to #X_1#'s group. He represents sincerity and innocence in world almost completely lacking those qualities. Though the friends initially mean to take advantage of him, the #X_0#'s goodness wins them over. #X_0# is always accompanied by his five dogs, which comfort and protect him, giving him a sixth sense to incoming danger.

-- #X_0# --
Whenever the paisanos of #Y_0# go a little to far in their mischief, they are put in the hands of #X_0#, the jailor. He was made jailor because as a youth he had been a guest in the prison so often that he knew how it was supposed to be run better than any other man. He is not part of the inner circle of #X_1#'s friends, but a good friend nonetheless.

-- #X_0# --
Though he is not a member of #X_1#'s inner circle of friends, #X_0# helps the group in many parts of the book. He is just another paisano trying to scrape his way through life and helping his friends when he can.

-- #X_0# --
As the bootlegger and tradesman of #Y_0# flat, it is only natural that #X_0# be the target for a lot of the paisanos frustration. He is a wealthy man, and being the holder of the town's wine supply, he is probably also the most powerful man in town.

-- #X_0# --
When Mr. #X_0# is not around, the paisanos have to go through #X_0#to get their wine and other goods. Often she barters commodities other than money, despite Mr. #X_0#'s efforts to keep her pure. For this weakness and for her plumpness, #X_0#is called Butter Duck by the paisanos.

-- #X_0# --
#Y_0# primary source of gossip, #X_0# is a very restless girl. She goes through husbands almost as quickly as the paisanos go through gallons of wine. When #X_1#'s friends talk, they often find fault in #X_0#'s activities, but they would all be more than willing to get involved with her.

-- #X_0# --
Mother of nine with another on the way, #X_1# is one of those people with a propensity for the "distillation of children." With her mother, #X_1# has a tough time maintaining her ever-growing household. To get by, she feeds the children an unwavering diet of tortillas and beans.

-- The #X_0#
 --
The #X_0# is one of the few characters that really teach the paisanos a lesson. Though a superior officer ruined his life, he has no thoughts of revenge, but only wishes for the well being of his baby.

-- #X_0# --
A forty-five year old widow of mostly Indian blood, #X_0# is not afraid to ask for what she wants. She is not the least bit subtle in her romantic pursuits of Big Joe.

-- #X_0# --
There is not much for a single, landowning woman to do in #Y_0# except pursue men, and that is exactly how #X_3# spends her days. She sits on her porch and waits for men to walk into her web like a spider. The man she really wants, however, is #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
The first-person narrator of almost the entire novel. #X_0# is the son of an innkeeper near #Y_0#, #Y_1#, and is probably in his early teens. He is eager and enthusiastic to go to sea and hunt for treasure. He is a modest narrator, never boasting of the remarkable courage and heroism he consistently displays. #X_0# is often impulsive and impetuous, but he exhibits increasing sensitivity and wisdom.

-- #X_0# --
The old seaman who resides at #X_2#’s parents’ inn. #X_0#, who used to be a member of #X_3#’s crew, is surly and rude. He hires #X_2# to be on the lookout for a one-legged man, thus involving the young #X_2# in the pirate life. #X_0#’s sea chest and treasure map set the whole adventure in motion. His gruff refusal to pay his hotel bills symbolizes the pirates’ general opposition to law, order, and civilization. His illness and his fondness for rum symbolize the weak and self-destructive aspects of the pirate lifestyle.

-- #X_0# --
A pirate and enemy of #X_1#. #X_0#pays an unexpected visit to #X_1# and threatens him. #X_1# attacks #X_0# #X_0#, who flees but remains a herald of coming violence in the novel. #X_0# #X_0#’s name symbolizes both the dark and the bestial sides of piracy.

-- #X_0# --
A local #Y_0# nobleman. #X_0# arranges the voyage to the island to find the treasure. He is associated with civic authority and social power, as well as with the comforts of civilized country life (his name suggests both “trees” and “lawn”). #X_0#’s street smarts, however, are limited, as the ease with which the pirates trick him into hiring them as his crew demonstrates.

-- #X_0# --
The local doctor. #X_0# is wise and practical, and #X_3# respects but is not inspired by him. #X_0# exhibits common sense and rational thought while on the island, and his idea to send #X_2# to spook the pirates reveals a deep understanding of human nature. He is fair-minded, magnanimously agreeing to treat the pirates with just as much care as his own wounded men. As his name suggests, #X_0# represents the steady, modest virtues of everyday life rather than fantasy, dream, or adventure.

-- #X_0# --
The captain of the voyage to #Y_0#. #X_0#is savvy and is rightly suspicious of the crew #Y_1# has hired. #X_0# is a real professional, taking his job seriously and displaying significant skill as a negotiator. Like #X_3#, #X_0# is too competent and reliable to be an inspirational figure for #X_2#’s teenage mind. #X_0# believes in rules and does not like #X_2#’s disobedience; he even tells #X_2# that he never wishes to sail with him again.

-- #X_0# --
The cook on the voyage to #Y_0#. #X_0# is the secret ringleader of the pirate band. His physical and emotional strength is impressive. #X_0# is deceitful and disloyal, greedy and visceral, and does not care about human relations. Yet he is always kind toward #X_2# and genuinely fond of the boy. #X_0# is a powerful mixture of charisma and self-destructiveness, individualism and recklessness.

-- #X_0# --
A former pirate marooned on Treasure Island. #X_2#’s pirate crew left #X_0# Gunn on the island for three years. #X_0#’s solitude has left him somewhat deranged, and he has the appearance of a wild man. He represents a degradation of the human spirit, yet his experience has left him morally superior to the pirates. He is the only character to be reformed, as he shifts sides from the pirates to the good men, willingly helping #X_3# and #X_4#. #X_0#’s uncanny imitations of the dead pirate #X_2#’s voice suggest that he is a kind of a ghost of a pirate.

-- #X_0# --
An old, blind beggar and pirate. #X_2# presents #X_1# with a black spot, an ultimatum to give up the sea chest’s contents to the pirate gang. #X_1# dies soon after #X_2#’s visit, and #X_2# then dies in a carriage accident. #X_2# can be seen as an angel of death, foreshadowing the many pirate deaths in the novel.

-- #X_0# --
The coxswain (a sailor who steers) on the ship. #X_0# is a former gunner on earlier pirate voyages. He is acting as one of two guards on the ship when the other pirates are ashore, but he gets drunk, kills the other guard, and lies in a drunken stupor while the ship drifts aimlessly. #X_0# symbolizes the reckless behavior of all the pirates.

-- #X_0# --
One of #X_1#’s sailor companions on the ship. #X_0# is killed by pirate gunfire and buried with great ceremony on the island, an event that illustrates the good men’s respect for the dead.

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the novel. #X_1# is the daughter of second-generation Americans living in #Y_0#, #Y_1# in the early twentieth century. She is named after her father's dead brother's fiancée. #X_1# is poor, but bright, observant, and taken by the wonders of the world. She is a combination of her hard-working, practical mother and her imaginative, dreaming father. She has a great capacity to see beauty amidst material hardship. Growing up without luxury, and sometimes without friends, she loves to read, and creates new worlds through her writing.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s mother. #X_0# comes from a family of strong women, and epitomizes this type. She is hard and detached ever since she had her two children and realized she could not depend on #X_3#, her husband to support her family. Ever since he was born, she has loved #X_4# more than her daughter, although she strives to treat them equally. She is extremely hard-working, she saves money as best she can, and will do anything so that her children can live a better quality life than she. Extremely proud, she vows that life isn't worth living once one gives in to charity.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s father. #X_0# is a young Irish singer-waiter as talented as he is weak. He is a dreamer without the resources or abilities to make his dreams reality. He loves his children, but is an alcoholic who can not always be a good father in a conventional way. #X_1# dreads his drunkenness, #X_0# is loved by #X_1# more than #X_2# is. Like #X_2# and #X_3#, #X_0# knows that an education will allow his children to live a better life than he has. He lives in a drunken dream world, where most of what he knows of life comes from the song lyrics he sings.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s younger brother by one year. Growing up, he and #X_1# experience life together and grow to be close friends. He is both a loving brother and a typical boy. He looks just like his father, and his mother thinks of him as someone she can be like #X_2#, without #X_2#'s faults. Indeed, he is musical, but hard-working, and does not like alcohol.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s oldest sister. The first of #X_3# daughters, she is the only daughter who has not learned to read and write. Her two failings are that she is a great lover and a great mother (even before she has a child of her own). Taken to an extreme, these qualities get her into trouble. These qualities also ensure that she is constantly giving, and never taking. Her charm with men means that she can convince them to believe or do almost anything. She has a reputation as an easy woman, but everyone who knows her knows that she is a good person. Her sisters always end up forgiving her foibles. #X_1# absolutely adores her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s older sister. Hard-working and practical, she does not understand #X_1#'s few bursts of wastefulness. She married #X_2# and works at his jobs when he no longer can. She does fantastic imitations, especially when poking fun at her husband.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s maternal grandmother, who came to #Y_0# from #Y_1#. She believes in the supernatural, tells ghost and fairy tales, and is a devout Catholic. She has hope for her family because #Y_0# makes dreams possible, and the in this country, the education is free. She is sure that #X_2# will have a better life than she did because #X_2# can read and write, and that #X_1#'s life will be better than #X_2#'s because she will go to school longer. Among other things, she advises #X_2# to save money so one day she can buy her own land, and read to her children every night.

-- #X_0# --
The saloon keeper in the bar where #X_1# hangs out and gets drunk. He is a dreamer. Wishing he had a family like #X_1#'s, he lives vicariously through #X_1#, and misses him enough to help out the family after he dies. He represents a means by which the Nolans feel #X_1#'s presence after his life.

-- #X_0# --
The girl who lives downstairs from the #X_5# in their house on #Y_0#, #X_0# is a teenager when #X_2# is a young girl. She is crazy about boys, and keeps a whole closet filled with costumes for Saturday night extravaganzas. Her favorite boy is #X_3#, who she ends up marrying. #X_0# is her younger brother who dies of consumption.

-- #X_0# --
A young boy who rides the dentists' wagon and takes care of his horse. #X_1# gives him more attention than he would like.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0# is #X_1#'s husband and #X_0# is his horse. They have a mutual hatred for each other. #X_0# feels he is a failure and often is the subject of #X_1#'s best imitations and jokes.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s third and last husband. The reader does not learn his real name (#X_2#) until very late in the book, since #X_1# calls all of her husbands and lovers "#X_0#." #X_2#, like all #X_1#'s men, goes along with her wishes almost all the time. By the end of the book, though, he stands up for himself.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# and #X_4#'s third child. She is born five months after #X_3# dies, when #X_2# is fourteen. She is named after a song #X_3# used to sing, and will carry Mr. #X_5#'s name.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s second husband, who she is about to marry when the book ends. He is a successful public figure, and so will support #X_2# and her children well. He is also a good man, faithful till the end to his sickly, troubled wife. He enters the book at the #Y_0# excursion.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s eighth grade English teacher. Self-righteous in her convictions, she believes that writing should only be about "beauty" not ugly things like poverty and drunkenness. Not only does she insult #X_1# about her background, but she also gives her poor marks on the compositions she wrote after #X_2#'s death, and does not allow #X_1# to write the graduation play.

-- #X_0# --
The janitor at #X_1#'s new school. He is loved and respected by the students and faculty even more than the principal. He represents the kindness that pervades this school, even for poor kids.

-- #X_0# --
A gruff but warmhearted man, he feels bad chucking the tree at #X_1# and #X_2#. Like many characters in #Y_0#, his rough speech and curses are meant to be taken kindly. Like many proprietors in #X_1#'s neighborhood, he reluctantly takes advantage of kids in order to feed his own.

The adult #X_0#relates certain aspects of his family history, including many that took place before his own birth, drawing from stories and hearsay as much as from his own memories. His opinions we get in abundance; of the actual details of his life the author furnishes only traces, and the child #X_0# turns out to be a minor character.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s philosophically-minded father. #X_0# #X_0#'s love for abstruse and convoluted intellectual argumentation and his readiness to embrace any tantalizing hypothesis lead him to propound a great number of absurd pseudo-scientific theories.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s mother. Mrs. #X_0# insists on having the midwife attend her labor rather than Dr. #X_2#, out of resentment at not being allowed to bear the child in #Y_0#. On all other points, Mrs. #X_0# is singularly passive and uncontentious, which makes her a dull conversational partner for her argumentative husband.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s uncle, and brother to Walter #X_0#. After sustaining a groin-wound in battle, he retires to a life of obsessive attention to the history and science of military fortifications. His temperament is gentle and sentimental: #X_2# tells us he wouldn't harm a fly.

-- #X_0# --
Manservant and sidekick to Uncle #X_3#. His real name is #X_2#; he received the nickname "#X_0#" while in the military. #X_0# colludes with Captain #X_3# in his military shenanigans, but his own favorite hobby is advising people, especially if it allows him to make eloquent speeches.

-- #X_0# --
The local male midwife, who, at #X_3#'s insistence, acts as a back-up at #X_2#'s birth. A "scientifick operator," #X_0# has written a book expressing his disdain for the practice of midwifery.

-- #X_0# --
The village parson, and a close friend of the #X_2# family. #X_0# is lighthearted and straight-talking; he detests gravity and pretension. As a witty and misunderstood clergyman, he has often been taken as a representation of the writer, #X_3#, himself.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s brother. #X_0#is a beer-swilling desert rat and petty thief who has come to their mother's house to loot the neighbors of household appliances. He is the exact opposite of his brother in looks, sensibility, and degree of success.

-- #X_0# --
A slick #Y_0# producer. While #X_1#'s characterization of #X_0# could easily have descended into parody, #X_0# remains real all the way through the play. He is as sincere as anyone who is motivated only by profit can be.

-- #X_0# --
An absurdist vision of a powerless mother. #X_0#thinks #X_3# is coming to town and quietly asks #X_1# not to kill #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s former student at #Y_0#, and the narrator of the book. After having abandoned his dreams of becoming a famous musician, he is disgusted by his desire for financial success and material wealth, though neither fill the void and unhappiness he feels. He has been working himself nearly to death, and suddenly finds himself out of a job when the staff at the newspaper he writes for decides to strike.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s favorite professor from #Y_0# University, and the focus of the book, #X_0# now suffers from ALS, a debilitating, incurable disease which ravages his body, but, cruelly, leaves him intellectually lucid. He had taught sociology at #Y_0#, and continues to teach it to #X_1#, instructing him on "The Meaning of Life," and how to accept death and aging. After a childhood in which affection was largely absent, he thrives on physical contact as a baby would. He has a passion for dancing and music, and is quick to cry, especially since the onset of his disease. He does not suffocate his emotions, but shares them openly, and rejects the popular cultural norms in favor of creating his own system of beliefs. #X_1# portrays him as a man of ultimate wisdom.

-- #X_0# --
One of the most famous living television interviewers, #X_0# conducts three interviews with #X_1# for the news show "Nightline." He is surprised when #X_1# asks him personal questions just after they have met, though he immediately seems to like #X_1#, and eventually grows to call him a friend.

#X_3#'s dispassionate father who immigrated to #Y_0# to escape the Russian Army. #X_0# raises his children on the Lower East Side of #Y_1#, and works in the fur business, though he seldom finds jobs and earns barely enough money to feed his family. He shows #X_3# and his brother #X_1# little attention, and no affection whatsoever, and insists that #X_3# keep his mother's death a secret from #X_1#, as he wants his son to believe that his stepmother, #X_2#, is his biological mother.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s younger brother who, after their mother's death, is sent with #X_1# to a small hotel in the woods of #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
The kind, caring immigrant woman who #X_1# marries after #X_3#'s mother dies. She gives #X_3# and his brother #X_2# the love and affection they have so longed for, and instills in #X_3# his love of books and desire for education.

-- #X_0# --
An old friend of #X_2#'s who he has long been estranged from. He had been an artist, and had sculpted a bust of #X_2#, a deft depiction of his features. He eventually moved away, and shortly thereafter, did not send his regards to #X_2# or #X_1# although he knew that #X_1# would be undergoing a serious surgery. Because of his carelessness, #X_2# forfeits his friendship with him and refuses to accept his apology, which he regrets, especially after his death a few years following their break up.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s home health aide who is always there to assist #X_1# in going to the bathroom, getting into his chair, and eating his meals. She is in disbelief when #X_2# is voted not guilty by the court jury.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# protagonist of the novella, a twenty-year-old woman who has been put in charge of educating and supervising #X_3# and #X_4# at the country estate of #X_2#. #X_0# governess has had a very sheltered upbringing and little life experience, and her new job puts an immense responsibility on her, since she has no one to supervise or help her. She is intelligent as well as sensitive and emotionally volatile. Over the course of two short interviews with her employer, she fell in love with him, but she has no opportunity to see him or communicate with him. She is extremely protective of her charges and hopes to win her employer’s approval. She views herself as a zealous guardian, a heroine facing dark forces. However, we never know for certain whether the ghosts and visions the governess sees are real or only figments of her imagination. No one else ever admits to seeing what she sees, and her fears, at times, seem to border on insanity.

-- #X_0# --
A servant who acts as the governess’s companion and confidante. #X_0#, who is illiterate, is very aware of her low standing in comparison with the governess and treats the governess with great respect. #X_0# listens patiently to the governess’s constantly changing theories and insights, most often claiming to believe her but sometimes questioning whether the ghosts may not be imaginary. The governess, however, tends to overwhelm #X_0#, often finishing #X_0#’s sentences or leaping to conclusions about what #X_0# is saying. Thus, it can sometimes be difficult for us to judge whether #X_0# is as strongly on the governess’s side as the governess thinks. #X_0# cares deeply about #X_2# and #X_3# and consistently defends them against the governess’s accusations.

-- #X_0# --
A ten-year-old boy, the elder of the governess’s two charges. #X_0# is charming and very attractive. He seems unnaturally well behaved and agreeable for a child, never fights with his sister, and tries constantly to please his governess. He is expelled from school for an unspecified but seemingly sinister reason, and although he seems to be a good child, he often hints that he is capable of being bad. The governess is alarmed by the fact that #X_0# never refers to his own past and suspects that wicked secrets belie his perfect exterior.

-- #X_0# --
An eight-year-old girl, the younger of the governess’s two charges. #X_0# is beautiful and well mannered, a pleasure to be around. Although the governess loves #X_0#, she is disturbed that #X_0#, like #X_2#, seems strangely impersonal and reticent about herself. #X_0# is affectionate and always ready with an embrace or a smile. She is so unusually well behaved that her first instance of misconduct is disquieting. The governess eventually becomes convinced that #X_0# sees the ghost of Miss #X_1# but keeps these sightings secret.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# governess’s employer, a bachelor who lives in #Y_1#. #X_0# uncle’s attractiveness is one of the main reasons the governess agrees to take on her role at #Y_0#. #X_0# uncle is friendly and pleasant, likely rich, and successful in charming women. He hires the governess on the condition that she handle his niece, nephew, and all problems at #Y_0# herself. He asks not to be bothered about them.

-- #X_0# --
A former valet at #X_1#. Red-haired, handsome, and exceedingly clever, #X_0# was “infamous” throughout the area of #X_1#. According to Mrs. #X_3#, he was a hound and “too free” with everyone, #X_4# and #X_2# included. The governess describes his specter as an unnaturally white, silent “horror.” She believes #X_0#’s ghost is haunting #X_1# with the intention of corrupting #X_4#.

-- #X_0# --
The governess’s predecessor. Mrs. #X_2# describes #X_0# as a lady, young and beautiful but “infamous.” #X_0# apparently had an inappropriate relationship with #X_3#, who was well below her class standing. The governess describes #X_0#’s black-clad ghost as miserable, pale, and dreadful. The governess believes #X_0#’s ghost is haunting #X_1# with the intention of corrupting #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A servant at #X_1#. #X_0# is expected to deliver the governess’s letter to the children’s uncle, but he cannot find it. #X_2# uses #X_0# as an attempted escape route and asks to see #X_0# before telling the governess what she wants to know.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator of the prologue. The anonymous narrator is an educated guest at the Christmas Eve gathering. The narrator is most likely a man, since he speaks disdainfully of the sensation-hungry women at the gathering. The narrator may be a stand-in for #X_2#, as he mentions he has a title for the tale at the end of the prologue. As #X_1# repeatedly hints, the narrator will find a deeper meaning in the story.

-- #X_0# --
The teller of the governess’s tale at the Christmas Eve gathering. #X_0# knew the governess, who had been his sister’s governess after her time at #X_1#, and may have been in love with her. He is the only one who has heard the tale, since the governess left him in charge of her manuscript after she died. #X_0# was fond of the governess and introduces her as a “most agreeable” person, giving her credibility regarding the tale to come.

-- #X_0# --
A storyteller at the gathering. #X_0# tells a ghost story involving a child and his mother.

-- #X_0# --
Guests at the house. The women are characterized as sensation hungry and eager to hear the most “dreadful” and “delicious” ghost stories.

-- #X_0# --
A young woman of aristocratic birth, and the play’s protagonist. Washed up on the shore of Illyria when her ship is wrecked in a storm, #X_0# decides to make her own way in the world. She disguises herself as a young man, calling herself "#X_1#," and becomes a page to Duke #X_3#. She ends up falling in love with #X_3#—even as #X_2#, the woman #X_3# is courting, falls in love with #X_1#. Thus, #X_0# finds that her clever disguise has entrapped her: she cannot tell #X_3# that she loves him, and she cannot tell #X_2# why she, as #X_1#, cannot love her. Her poignant plight is the central conflict in the play.

-- #X_0# --
A powerful nobleman in the country of #Y_0#. #X_0# is lovesick for the beautiful Lady #X_2#, but becomes more and more fond of his handsome new page boy, #X_1#, who is actually a woman—#X_3#. #X_0# is a vehicle through which the play explores the absurdity of love: a supreme egotist, #X_0# mopes around complaining how heartsick he is over #X_2#, when it is clear that he is chiefly in love with the idea of being in love and enjoys making a spectacle of himself. His attraction to the ostensibly male #X_1# injects sexual ambiguity into his character.

-- #X_0# --
A wealthy, beautiful, and noble Illyrian lady, #X_0# is courted by #X_3# and Sir #X_1#, but to each of them she insists that she is in mourning for her brother, who has recently died, and will not marry for seven years. She and #X_3# are similar characters in that each seems to enjoy wallowing in his or her own misery. #X_4#’s arrival in the masculine guise of #X_2# enables #X_0# to break free of her self-indulgent melancholy. #X_0# seems to have no difficulty transferring her affections from one love interest to the next, however, suggesting that her romantic feelings—like most emotions in the play—do not run deep.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#’s lost twin brother. When he arrives in #Y_0#, traveling with #X_1#, his close friend and protector, #X_0# discovers that many people think that they know him. Furthermore, the beautiful Lady #X_3#, whom he has never met, wants to marry him. #X_0# is not as well rounded a character as his sister. He seems to exist to take on the role that #X_4# fills while disguised as #X_2#—namely, the mate for #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The straitlaced steward—or head servant—in the household of Lady #X_3#. #X_0# is very efficient but also very self-righteous, and he has a poor opinion of drinking, singing, and fun. His priggishness and haughty attitude earn him the enmity of Sir #X_4#, Sir #X_1#, and #X_2#, who play a cruel trick on him, making him believe that #X_3# is in love with him. In his fantasies about marrying his mistress, he reveals a powerful ambition to rise above his social class.

-- #X_0# --
The clown, or fool, of #X_1#’s household, #X_0# moves between #X_1#’s and #X_2#’s homes. He earns his living by making pointed jokes, singing old songs, being generally witty, and offering good advice cloaked under a layer of foolishness. In spite of being a professional fool, #X_0# often seems the wisest character in the play.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#’s uncle. #X_4# lets #X_0# Belch live with her, but she does not approve of his rowdy behavior, practical jokes, heavy drinking, late-night carousing, or friends (specifically the idiotic #X_0# #X_1#). #X_0# also earns the ire of #X_2#. But #X_0# has an ally, and eventually a mate, in #X_4#’s sharp-witted waiting-gentlewoman, #X_3#. Together they bring about the triumph of chaotic spirit, which #X_0# embodies, and the ruin of the controlling, self-righteous #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s clever, daring young waiting-gentlewoman. #X_0# is remarkably similar to her antagonist, #X_1#, who harbors aspirations of rising in the world through marriage. But #X_0# succeeds where #X_1# fails—perhaps because she is a woman, but, more likely, because she is more in tune than #X_1# with the anarchic, topsy-turvy spirit that animates the play.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of #X_0# #X_3#’s. #X_0# attempts to court #X_2#, but he doesn’t stand a chance. He thinks that he is witty, brave, young, and good at languages and dancing, but he is actually an idiot.

-- #X_0# --
A man who rescues #X_1# after his shipwreck. #X_0# has become very fond of #X_1#, caring for him, accompanying him to #Y_0#, and furnishing him with money—all because of a love so strong that it seems to be romantic in nature. #X_0#’s attraction to #X_1#, however, never bears fruit. Despite the ambiguous and shifting gender roles in the play, Twelfth Night remains a romantic comedy in which the characters are destined for marriage. In such a world, homoerotic attraction cannot be fulfilled.

-- #X_0# --
The author, subject, and protagonist of the narrative. #X_0# was a free Black man from #Y_1# who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1841. He remained enslaved in #Y_0# until 1853. A well-spoken, well-liked entrepreneur from the North, #X_0# endures his twelve years of enslavement with ingenuity and strength, but he suffers at the hands of cruel masters. As narrator, #X_0# is often dispassionate and journalistic in his approach, but he sometimes portrays his own feelings of despair, anger, and bitterness in intimate detail.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s master for ten years. #X_0# is an especially cruel master who punishes his slaves for his own amusement when he is drunk. When sober, #X_0#’s cruelty is even more targeted and purposeful. #X_2# says that no kindness or justice could be found in #X_0#’s heart.

-- #X_0# --
A particularly talented, intelligent woman and a slave on #X_1#’s plantation. #X_0# is described as the queen of the cottonfield, outpicking her fellow slaves each day. She also faces the torture of being subject to #X_1#’s sexual aggression and his wife’s jealousy over it. #X_0# is whipped and tortured, and her spirit is eventually broken by her cruel masters.

-- #X_0# --
A cruel overseer and master of plantations on the Red River. #X_0# is the first dangerous antagonist #X_3# meets in #Y_0#. He displays a cruel and violent personality. #X_0# targets #X_3#, and his attacks result in #X_3#’s near-lynching and eventual sale to #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s first master in #Y_0#. #X_0# is described as a compassionate and caring man who is nevertheless blind to the blatant immorality of slavery. #X_0# protects #X_1# from #X_2#’s wrath and treats #X_1# with kindness and respect. He later forces #X_2# to sell #X_1#, likely saving his life.

-- #X_0# --
The story’s older main character. #X_0# is an art dealer and #X_3#’s uncle, the husband of #X_3#’s mother’s younger sister, #X_1#. #X_0# was born and bred in #Y_0# and has an intimate relationship with the city.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator. He is an adventurous fellow in his early twenties who longs for liberty so much that he flees his whaling ship in order to live amongst the natives. He also is a fairly open minded American. He is able to appreciate and accept the native culture for its refinement and nobility, unlike many other Europeans and Americans who simply dismiss it as heathen without any appreciation of its arts.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a young, quiet man who agrees to accompany the narrator on his adventure. We are told that #X_0# speaks rarely, but that he smiles and never speaks of his past. During their adventure, #X_0# serves primarily to complement the narrator's character. Their opinions and perspectives frequently are contrary to one another. For example, while #X_0# believes that they are heading into the Happar valley, #X_1# thinks it likely belongs to the #X_2#. When #X_1# feels happy in the valley, #X_0# remains distrustful of the people around him. #X_0#'s character is not as fully developed as #X_1#'s, but he does remain a loyal friend who is inadvertently separated from #X_1# in the end.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the beautiful maiden with whom #X_2# falls in love. #X_0# has blue eyes, olive skin, and long dark tresses. She represents the ultimate in innocence and beauty in the Typee landscape. Her character is an allusion to #X_1# in Eden. Like the first woman, #X_0# fully captivates #X_2# with her loveliness. Some critics, however, have noted that #X_0#'s character is never developed, so she remains a largely symbolic figure whose inner thoughts remain hidden.

-- #X_0# --
The man appointed to be #X_3#'s servant. #X_0# is a kind, industrious fellow who constantly attends to #X_3#. His character is slightly comic because he is always running around pantomiming to #X_3# when #X_3# does not understand. #X_2# appearance itself is slightly comic as he is heavily tattooed and has a shaven head except for two large tufts of hair that flop about. Despite his comic role, #X_0# is faithful and kind, always caring for #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The most important chief of the Typees. #X_0#'s status amongst the Typees is similar to that of a king. #X_0# is a noble and dignified figure whom everyone, including #X_1#, treats with respect. #X_0# is also friendly. #X_1# spends almost every afternoon sitting and eating with him because he so enjoys #X_0#'s company. #X_0# is a classic "noble savage," someone so dignified that they do not need the trappings of civilization to demonstrate the fine person within. His stature speaks for itself.

-- #X_0# --
The senior man in the house where #X_1# lives. #X_0# is kind and sympathetic. He often gives #X_1# compassionate glances when they are around the house. In the final scene, it is #X_0# who insists that #X_1# should be free because he needs to return to "home" and "mother."

-- #X_0# --
The very industrious wife of #X_2#. #X_0# is an expert at preparing "poee- poee" the classic breadfruit dish of the island. #X_3# believes that she is perhaps the hardest working person in the whole valley. Aside from profiling her culinary skills, her character is not developed.

-- #X_0# --
A Typee warrior whose head #X_2# shaves. Later #X_0# is injured in a battle with the #X_1#. His character is not further developed.

-- #X_0# --
A native who enjoys "taboo" status and who is able to therefore wander around the island. #X_0# is an elegant person who possesses a dignified stature as well as sexually alluring qualities. #X_1# feels attracted to #X_0# just like all the Typees do. #X_0# is described as a Polynesian "Apollo." #X_0# ultimately is also a kind figure because it is he who tells other natives that #X_1# is amongst the Typees, which eventually leads to #X_1#'s rescue.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0# of the Dolly. #X_0# is a cruel captain who overworks his crew and fails to care for their needs. #X_0#'s heartlessness can be contrasted with #X_1#'s generosity. While #X_0# tries to enslave his crew in a barren landscape without food, #X_1# offers up food and feasts to his people in the lush Polynesian valley. #X_0#'s name even sounds harsh.

-- #X_0# --
A fierce one-eyed chieftain who appears several times, mostly at the very end of the book. #X_0# is a threatening figure who primarily serves to contrast with the gentler nobility of Chief #X_2#. The expression of #X_0#'s ferocity is the final image we receive of the #X_4#. It is not consistent with the peaceful image that has been developed throughout the book.

-- #X_0# --
The native man who comes to rescue #X_2#. Little is know about him except that he lives around the Nukuheva Bay and interacts frequently with the Europeans there. Because he helps to free #X_2#, he appears to be a good, friendly figure.

-- #X_0# --
An old European sailor who settled down on the islands and who speaks the native Polynesian tongue. He often interprets for the Frenchmen. He also enjoys "taboo" status, allowing him to travel through the island with no harm from the natives. #X_0# appears to be an unkind figure, since he basically trades #X_1# away to a whaling ship with no consideration that #X_2# will be trapped.

-- #X_0# --
The chief priest of the Typees. He presides over the Feast of the Calabashes and frequently conducts rituals with #X_1#, the chief Typeean God.

He is preoccupied by his estrangement from his wife, #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
An aspiring poet in his early twenties. #X_0# is intelligent and extremely well-read, and he likes music. He seems to exist more for himself, in a cerebral way, than as a member of a community or even the group of medical students that he associates with. #X_0# was extremely religious as a child, but now he struggles with issues of faith and doubt in the wake of his mother’s death, which occurred less than a year ago.

-- #X_0# --

Other men look up to him, even though his home life has been in disarray since his wife died. #X_0# has a good singing voice and a talent for funny stories, and he might have capitalized on these assets if not for his drinking habit. #X_0# is extremely critical of #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is the pseudonym of #X_1#, a famous poet of #Y_0# who is at the center of Irish literary circles—circles that do not include #X_2#. He is deeply interested in esoteric mysticism. Other men consult #X_0# for wisdom as if he were an oracle.

After falling in love with and marrying the emotionally needy #X_1#, #X_0# finds himself trapped between the womanizing he cannot give up, and his genuine love for his new wife. In a politically charged time, #X_0# is an independent thinker and hence objectionable to the Communist government, but personally he would identify himself as apolitical. In many ways, especially sexually, #X_0# is "light," a libertine.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s young wife. #X_0# grew up in a small Czech town, brought up in the vulgar and invasive presence of her mother. Seeking escape from that small world, #X_0# worships books, culture, and kindness. Identifying #X_1# as a kindred spirit and outsider, she falls in love instantly and permanently. In #Y_0#, #X_1#'s womanizing drives #X_0# to the brink of insanity. Although she attempts to understand her husband and his lifestyle and cannot argue with him logically, #X_0# is unable to be "light" about her love or sexuality. She finds some fulfillment in her work as photographer, especially during the Soviet tank occupation; she does dangerous and politically dissident work as a photojournalist.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#'s favorite mistress and closest friend. A talented painter. #X_0# betrays, successively, her father's home, her art school, her lovers, and ultimately her country. #X_0# is as beautiful and original as her artwork; early in life, she identified ki tsch, or bad, sentimental, insistently sunny propaganda art, and lives her life as an attack on kitsch. She cares deeply for both #X_3# and #X_2#, even if she cannot understand why #X_3# would trade his freedom for domesticity. Ultimately her desire for freedom leads #X_0# to leave her love, #X_1#, and lose all contact with her past. #X_0# is the "lightest" character in the novel.

-- #X_0# --
A #Y_0# professor and idealist. #X_1#'s lover. #X_0# falls in love with #X_1#, whom he (erroneously) considers a liberal and romantically tragic Czech dissident. #X_1# considers both of those identities kitsch. He is tortured by the fact that he must betray his wife in order to see #X_1#. Ultimately he leaves his wife in what to him is an act of courage, but to #X_1# seems an unhappy and sentimental choice. #X_0# identifies strongly with the European liberal left, loves parades and marches, and idol izes his dead mother. Abandoned by #X_1#, he finds solace in the arms of a perfectly ordinary young student who loves him.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s son by his first wife. #X_0#is a dreamer and always idealized his father, who did not wish to know him.

-- #X_0# --
Uncle #X_2#’s wife and the #X_1#’ cook. #X_0# often acts like a jovial simpleton around the #X_1# to mask her more complex feelings.

-- #X_0# --
The owner of Uncle #X_3# in #Y_0#, #X_0# sells #X_3# to the cruel Mr. #X_1# to pay off his debts. An educated, kind, and basically good-hearted man, #X_0# nonetheless tolerates and perpetuates slavery. #X_2# uses him to illustrate that the immorality inherent in slavery makes villains of all its practitioners—not just the most cruel masters.

-- #X_0# --
Mr. #X_0#’s wife, #X_0# is a loving, Christian woman who does not believe in slavery. She uses her influence with her husband to try to help the #X_0#s’ slaves and is one of the novel’s many morally virtuous and insightful female characters.

-- #X_0# --
Called “Mas’r #X_0#” by Uncle #X_2#, #X_0# is the #X_0#s’ good-hearted son. He loves #X_2# and promises to rescue him from the cruelty into which his father sold him. After #X_2# dies, he resolves to free all the slaves on the family farm in #Y_0#. More morally committed than his father, #X_0# not only possesses a kind heart but acts on his principles.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s husband and an intellectually curious and talented mulatto, #X_0# loves his family deeply and willingly fights for his freedom. He confronts the slave hunter #X_2# and does not hesitate to shoot him when he imperils the family.

Mrs. #X_4#’s maid, #X_1#’s wife, and #X_3#’s mother, #X_0# is an intelligent, beautiful, and brave young slave. After Mr. #X_4# makes known his plans to sell #X_0#’s son to Mr. #X_2#, she proves the force of her motherly love as well as her strength of spirit by making a spectacular escape. Her crossing of the Ohio River on patches of ice is the novel’s most famous scene.

-- #X_0# --
Eliza and George’s son, a young boy.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#’s master in #Y_0# and #X_1#’s father, #X_0# #X_0# is a flighty and romantic man, dedicated to pleasure. #X_0# #X_0# does not believe in God, and he carouses and drinks every night. Although he dotes on his daughter and treats his slaves with compassion, #X_0# #X_0# shares the hypocrisy of Mr. #X_2# in that he sees the evil of slavery but nonetheless tolerates and practices it.

-- #X_0# --
St. #X_2# and #X_5#’s angelic daughter. #X_0#, also referred to in the book as Little #X_0# (her given name is #X_0#ngeline) is presented as an absolutely perfect child—a completely moral being and an unimpeachable #X_1#ian. She laments the existence of slavery and sees no difference between blacks and whites. After befriending #X_6# while still a young girl, #X_0# becomes one of the most important figures in his life. In death, #X_0# becomes one of the text’s central #X_1# figures.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# cousin from the North (#Y_0#) who comes to help him manage the household, #X_0# opposes slavery in the abstract. However, she finds actual slaves somewhat distasteful and harbors considerable prejudice against them. After #X_1#’s death, and through her relationship with #X_4#, #X_0# realizes her failings and learns to see slaves as human beings. #X_3# hoped that much of her Northern audience might recognize themselves in #X_0# and reconsider their views on slavery.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# wife, a self-centered woman. Petty, whining, and foolish, she is the very opposite of the idealized woman figure that appears repeatedly throughout  the novel.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, a Christian group that arose in mid-seventeenth-century #Y_1#, dedicated themselves to achieving an inner understanding of God, without the use of creeds, clergy, or outward rites. #X_0# have a long history of contributing to social reform and peace efforts. In Uncle Tom’s Cabin, many Quaker characters appear who help #X_2# and #X_1#, as well as many other slaves. #X_3# uses them to portray a #Y_0# free of hypocrisy, self-righteous display, or bigoted conventions. This kind of #Y_0#, she implies, can play a crucial role in the abolition  of slavery.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0# is another example of the virtuous woman. She tries to exert influence through her husband. #X_0# #X_0# exemplifies the well-meaning man who is sympathetic to the abolitionist cause but who nonetheless remains complacent or resigned to the status quo.

-- #X_0# --
A slave hunter hired by Mr. #X_3# to bring back #X_1#, #X_4#, and #X_2#, #X_0# first appears as a gruff, violent man. #X_2# shoots him when he tries to capture them, and, after he is healed by the #Y_0#, #X_0# experiences a transformation and chooses to join the #Y_0# rather than return to his old life.

-- #X_0# --
The slave trader who buys #X_3# and #X_1# from #X_0# #X_2#. A gruff, coarse man, #X_0# presents himself as a kind individual who treats his slaves well. #X_0#, however, mistreats his slaves, often violently.

-- #X_0# --
A wild and uncivilized slave girl whom Miss #X_3# tries to reform, #X_0# gradually learns to love and respect others by following the example of #X_2#.

#X_1#’s ruthlessly evil master on the #Y_0# plantation. A vicious, barbaric, and loathsome man, #X_0# fosters violence and hatred among his slaves.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s (slave) mistress and #X_2#’s mother, #X_0# proves a proud and intelligent woman and devises a clever way to escape #X_3#’s plantation.

-- #X_0# --
A young and beautiful slave girl whom #X_2# buys for himself, perhaps to replace #X_1# as his mistress. She has been raised as a pious Christian.

-- #X_0# --
The hero of the play, #X_5# (a nickname for "#X_0#" that is analogous to "#X_2#" or "#X_3#" in English) is a bitter, broken man who has wasted his life toiling on the estate of his brother-in-law, #X_4#. He is consumed with his lost life and obsessed with what might have been—a prime object of this obsession being the elusive #X_6#. He functions as the play's misanthrope, offering a number of humorous caricatures of those around him. He is thus privileged with a certain bitter insight even as his friends and acquaintances dismiss him.

-- #X_0# --
Plagued by gout and rheumatism, the pompous and egotistical #X_0# is a failed scholar, deeply embittered by the onset of old age. He finds himself detestable in his infirmity and bemoans his residence in the provinces and his tomb-like estate, tormented by the meaningless chatter and indifference of his family. Notably he is terrified by his brother-in-law #X_3#, perhaps betraying some latent remorse at having exploited him for his livelihood. In any case, #X_0# is quick to cover over tensions in the household and reassert his preeminence. #X_2# names him his "bitterest enemy."

-- #X_0# --
The professor's beautiful wife, #X_0# (the Russian equivalent of the Greek "#X_2#") fascinates all the major characters of the play, causing them to abandon their duties and fall into idleness. Indeed, she is characterized throughout the play by her infectious idleness and lack of interest in any serious work. Raised in #Y_0#, she sacrificed a budding music career to marry the aging #X_3#, whom she does not love but remains bound to him by conscience, convention, and inertia. Like a number of the play's characters, she suffers from a certain sense of self-estrangement, understanding herself as an "incidental character" in her own life.

-- #X_0# --
The play's brooding and deliberate philosopher, #X_0# is an overworked country doctor who feels ruined by provincial life. He is almost always deep in introspection, finding himself numb to the world, unable to want and love, and dejected at the thought that he will be forgotten in the course of time. Continually described as "eccentric" and "strange," he nevertheless is something of a visionary in his passion for conversation, decrying the degeneration of the land and destructive impulse he finds in man and hoping to leave his legacy to future generations. According to critic Eugene #X_2#, #X_0#'s name suggests the word for "stars," which #X_2# perhaps simplistically reads as in keeping with his high moral purpose.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s daughter by his first marriage, #X_4# is named after the Greek for wisdom ("sophia"), though one wonders if she is particularly wise. Gentle but homely, she has steadfastly given herself to the maintenance of the estate and pines hopelessly after the brooding Dr. #X_1# amidst all her drudgery. Throughout the play, she will be quick to chastise those who would disrupt the household—her father in particular—and will joylessly rededicate herself to her toils at the end of the play.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_2#'s mother. She is still enthralled with the professor, and passes her days usually annotating pamphlets on various social issues. #X_2# probably describes her best in Act I: as a woman with one eye "fastened on the grave" and the other fixed on "her books of learning for the dawn of a new life."

-- #X_0# --
Nicknamed "#X_2#" for his pockmarked face, #X_0# is an impoverished landowner who works on the estate. He is largely a comic figure, pathetic in his love life, cowed by conflict in the household, and prone to make the occasional inappropriate interjections. He is also the play's on-stage musician, playing the guitar in a number of scenes.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a kind, elderly, and devout nurse. Apparently finding a beneficent sense of order in the monotonous life of the estate, she resents the disruption of routine that the others have brought to the household. She delivers religious platitudes throughout the play and offers comfort to a number of characters (#X_4#, #X_2#, #X_3#, etc.).

-- #X_0# --
A teenage migrant laborer and  protagonist of the novel. #X_0# is strong and determined. She takes care of her younger siblings and works as hard as the other adult laborers. She is also called #X_1#, a nickname her now-absent father gave her in childhood. Though she is only thirteen, #X_0# has a grim resolve that is more adult than her years.

-- #X_0# --
The matriarch of #X_1#’s family. #X_0# is religious, hard-working, and protective of her children. At thirty-five, her body is so damaged by hard labor that her varicose veins make it hard to walk. #X_0# is stubborn and tough on her children, especially #X_1#, but she carries a deep love for her eldest daughter, who often refers to her as “the mother.”

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s partner, a much older man who has already raised one set of children to adulthood. #X_0# is known for the perfection of his craftsmanship. He struggles with his desire to leave the fields for #Y_0# and his knowledge that #X_2# and her children depend on him. #X_0# also sometimes dreams of his dead wife.

-- #X_0# --
A motherless sixteen-year-old laborer and #X_1#’s love interest. #X_0# has come from #Y_1# with his cousin, #X_2#, to work the fields in #Y_0#. Industrious and clever, #X_0# longs to go to school and study geology. He admires #X_1# and is almost obsessive in his pursual of her.

-- #X_0# --
The twins, #X_1#’s younger sisters. #X_2# and #X_0# are curious and guileless, naïve, and playful in contrast to #X_1#’s seriousness. They often find their way into trouble while exploring their world.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s younger brothers. #X_0# are rambunctious and still childlike, alternately tattling on #X_1# and treating her like a second mother.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s cousin and partner in crime. #X_0# is anxious about breaking the rules of the camp, though he helps #X_1# steal peaches to sell. He is often frightened of #X_2#, a woman from a Mexican ghost story who is said to have drowned her children.

-- #X_0# --
A proud and violent man who has abandoned the family and returned to #Y_0#. #X_1# remembers him as a larger-than-life figure, and #X_2# still thinks of him constantly.

-- #X_0# --
A rough and tough white girl whose family is known for criminal behavior and shamelessness. #X_0# was #X_1#’s friend at a previous work camp, until an altercation between the girls caused #X_1#’s family to be evicted.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# only health clinic worker. Cheerful but brusque, the nurse does not truly care about the needs of the family or #X_2#. She is condescending in her treatment of the migrant worker family.

-- #X_0# --
A mysterious young boy sometimes seen in the barn. Referred to by the children as “the harelip boy” because of his cleft palate, his sudden appearance spooks #X_3# and later #X_2#. It is unclear whether he is a real child or a ghost.

-- #X_0# --
The deceased mother of #X_1#’s children. #X_0# lost her faith in God after their first baby died, and she later lost her life to cancer.

-- #X_0# --
A field worker to whom #X_2# gives a peach. His Japanese name is a reminder that not all of the laborers are Chicano.

-- #X_0# --
The foreman of the previous labor camp where #X_1#’s family worked. #X_0# lies about the safety of the drinking water, showing disregard for the health of his workers.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# overseer of the farm workers at the current labor camp.

-- #X_0# --
The novel's narrator and protagonist. The novel traces his coming of age from the time he is twelve until he is a grown man and the head of his family. #X_0# is decent, honorable, courageous and intelligent, a model Southern aristocrat for the post-war era. As a boy, he is occasionally given to impetuousness and rashness. In the course of the novel he matures profoundly, gaining a sense of the tragedy of life and learning to balance the often-violent chivalry of the traditional Southern gentleman with sensitivity and mercy.

-- #X_0# --
A black slave born the same month as #X_1#, who is his best friend and constant companion. #X_0# (short for #X_2#) is the smarter of the two boys, and displays savvy and entrepreneurism as well as a sense of humor that #X_1# lacks. He is bold and courageous, and accompanies #X_1# on his most dangerous and difficult adventures. Even after the slaves are freed, he continues to serve #X_1# with the same unfailing devotion as before.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s proud and glorious father, the patriarch of the #X_0# family. #X_0# #X_0# commands his own regiment on the #Y_1# front until he is demoted by his troops so he can return home to care for his family; even then, he raises an "irregular" brigade who terrorize the far more numerous Yankees in #Y_0# with their dashing assaults. He is a larger-than-life figure, hot- blooded and arrogant but unceasingly heroic, and #X_2# worships him. When he dies at the end of the novel, his son begins to assume his grandeur and valor.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s older cousin, who abandons home to join the Confederate army after her fiancé is killed. She is fierce, violent, militaristic and stubbornly independent, but displays a moving vulnerability when her mother tries to confine her and force her to be feminine. Eventually, she is pressured into marrying Colonel #X_2# after living with him on the front as a common soldier. #X_0# is the book's most tragic figure, confined by a narrow Southern womanhood that almost breaks her spirit. The book seems to hint that she is in love with #X_1#, though she only expresses her passion in a few intense moments.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s grandmother, #X_4# #X_0# a stubborn old woman who becomes the novel's most authentic hero. At first #X_4# seems difficult to like: she is cold and severe, quick to punish others, insistent on having her own way and rigidly moral, even though her morality does not prevent her from lying and cheating when she has to. In fact, she sets up an audacious mule-stealing scam against the #Y_0# that lasts for almost a year, which relies on her fragile, elderly appearance and her brilliant cunning. But despite these apparent flaws, #X_3# clearly feels a genuine affection for her, and ultimately portrays her as a tireless crusader for her family and for the poor people of the county, every bit as chivalrous as #X_2# or Colonel #X_6#. Her death at the hands of a cowardly bandit is the novel's turning point and its emotional climax.

-- #X_0# --
A practical, devoted slave of the #X_2# family. #X_0# is the equivalent of the family mammy, and like the stereotypical mammy she is ornery but ultimately loyal and affectionate. She has no desire to be free, and angrily criticizes #X_1# for turning on the #X_2#es, calling him an ingrate and a fool.

-- #X_0# --
A shiftless, lower-class farmer who represents the ugly future of the white South. In other #X_3# novels the #X_0# family represents a class of degraded poor whites who eventually rise in power and overwhelm old aristocrats like the #X_6#. #X_0#is no exception: he is lazy, greedy and cowardly and betrays #X_4# twice, first to the Yankees and then to the bandit #X_5#. Though he comes across as good-natured at first, he is the novel's most unappealing character, and the fact that he escapes without punishment represents a breach in the moral order.

-- #X_0# --
A brave but undeniably eccentric old man who lives with his brother #X_0# #X_2# on the outskirts of town. #X_0# and #X_2# (whose real names are Amodeus and #X_5#) are true town characters, who live in a converted slave cabin while their slaves live in the main house. They give their slaves considerable freedom and are beloved by the poor hill people for their generosity and leadership—the polar opposite of the #X_4#. #X_0#, forced to stay home in #Y_0# while his brother is away at the war, accompanies #X_1# on his quest for revenge against #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s mother, a weepy, melodramatic woman who is constantly shocked by her daughter's independence. She eventually moves in with #X_1#'s family to try to rein in #X_2# and force her to conform to feminine expectations. Finally she defeats #X_2# and successfully insists that she marry Colonel #X_3#.

-- #X_0# --
The village priest. As an authority figure in the community, #X_0# takes it upon himself to discern whether the old man is an angel as the townsfolk believe or just a mortal who just happens to have wings. #X_0# is skeptical that the dirty old man could really be a messenger from heaven, but he dutifully reports the event to his superiors in the church. As he waits for the #Y_0#’s reply, he does his best to restrain the enthusiasm and credulousness of the crowd of onlookers.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3# and #X_2#’s bossy neighbor. #X_0# supposedly wise neighbor woman actually seems more like a silly know-it-all than a true counselor and is the first to suggest that the old man is a crippled angel.

The youngest of the #X_0# girls. #X_0#, age thirteen, is mystical, precocious, shy, and known even by her older sisters as the weird one of the family. She habitually wears an ill-fitting vintage 1920s wedding gown, stained and cut short. She bites her nails, invokes #X_1#, and spends hours listening to wailing Celtic music that she has ordered by mail. In her meticulous diary entries, discovered after her death, #X_0# is remarkably unself-conscious, tending to speak of her sisters and herself as a single entity. In her first suicide attempt she slits her wrists during one of her marathon baths, and begins the #X_0# cycle of tragedies. Her second, successful suicide attempt cements the cycle when she jumps onto a spiked fence. At the time of her suicide, she has just begun to menstruate.

-- #X_0# --
The second youngest of the #X_0# girls. Beautiful, sexy, slim, mischievous, adventurous, and eventually promiscuous, #X_0#, age fourteen, epitomizes all that the boys desire about the #X_0# girls. She is a secret smoker since the age of twelve, and is seen laughing with delinquent boys and getting rides on motorcycles long before she begins her campaign of sex on the #X_0# roof. Though smoking and having sex outdoors in winter hint at a self-destructive streak, #X_0# appears to act clearly and deliberately, leaving the boys to wonder about her real plans. The only person who seems to catch #X_0# off-guard is #X_2# Fontaine, her masculine foil, in the final moments of Homecoming. #X_0#'s adventures have wildly varying consequences for her sisters' lives. It is out of love for #X_0# that #X_2# persuades the #X_0# parents to let the girls attend the dance, affording them several exquisite hours of happiness. But it is also #X_0#'s subsequent failure to make curfew that results in the sisters' confinement to the house for most of the winter, with disastrous consequences. #X_0# dies on the night of June fifteen from carbon monoxide poisoning.

-- #X_0# --
The middle child in the #X_0# family. #X_0#, age fifteen, has a sallow complexionedand is a foot taller than any of her sisters, with a sharp nose and long neck.

-- #X_0# --
The second oldest of the #X_0# girls. #X_0# #X_0#, age sixteen, is prim, proper, poised, and spends hours in front of the mirror.

After her unsuccessful suicide attempt on the night of June fifteen, #X_0# spends a month sleeping and obsessively showering while the community faithfully awaits her death. She dies in July by taking sleeping pills.

-- #X_0# --

She will die on the night of June fifteen from a combination of sleeping pills and gin.

-- #X_0# --
The father of the #X_0# family. A thin, effeminate, retiring man with a high, boyish voice, #X_0#teaches math at the local high school, for which his daughters receive free tuition. He has been a teacher for as long as anyone can remember, and he seems to enjoy his job and to throw himself into his work. Although he loves his daughters, he finds them to be complete strangers. Despite his accommodating nature, he often feels lost amid the flurry of femininity at home, humiliated by being sent on endless trips to the drugstore for Tampax. #X_0#is completely cowed by his domineering wife, deferring to her decisions almost automatically. He is unable to even try to challenge her opinion or change her mind. As the novel's tragedy unfolds, #X_0#withdraws further into his private world—he eats lunch in his classroom alone at school, he watches baseball obsessively, and after Homecoming he seems unaware of his wife's decision to keep the girls at home, as his tenuous hold on reality begins to slip.

-- #X_0# --
The mother of the #X_0# family. #X_0#, a vehement, forceful matriarch, is the de facto head of the #X_0# household. Heavy and commandeering, with steel- wool hair and glasses, she bears little resemblance to her five lovely daughters, leaving the boys to wonder how she could have produced them. She rules the house with an iron fist, strictly supervising the girls' comings and goings, television watching, and church attendance. She is insistently Catholic, and many of her rules for the girls—no makeup, no even slightly revealing clothes, and ultimately no rock music—reflect her brand of piety. #X_0# reacts strongly to cracks in her totalitarian regime, responding to #X_2#'s breaking curfew on Homecoming by withdrawing the girls from school entirely and locking them in the house "to recover." She is permanently suspicious of the outside world, with a firm belief that girls are best and happiest at home under a mother's watchful eye. Despite her forcefully maternal rhetoric, however, #X_0# seems progressively uninterested or unable to attend to the physical welfare of her daughters, taking to her bed for weeks after #X_1#'s death. Her housekeeping, fully average as the novel begins, rapidly disintegrates after the first suicide, as the house becomes a jungle of open cans, half-eaten food, mail-order catalogs, and dust.

-- #X_0# --
The high school stud. #X_0# emerges from an unspectacular childhood to become the handsomest boy in high school. Fully aware of his masculine power, #X_0# takes great care of his appearance, entrance, clothing, and hair. He swaggers down the hall and suns himself daily in the family pool. #X_0# cares little for school, and instead takes regular trips to his car to smoke marijuana and run a minor drug business on the side. Female admirers, who swoon at his every move and climb willingly into his bed, continually surround him. His recurrent erotic success is assured by his intuitive, gentlemanly discretion, which never allows him to reveal the details of his conquests. When #X_0# meets #X_1# and falls overwhelmingly in love, #X_0# has no idea how to pursue her, having always been the one pursued. Though he interacts with the neighborhood boys, #X_0# is not one of them, and is not part of the novel's narrative voice.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# narrators of the novel. "#X_0# #X_0# #X_0#" are an indistinct group, comprising a number of #X_0# mentioned in the narrative, but not necessarily limited to those mentioned.

His search of the bathroom reveals that at least one girl has begun her period, and he is able to steal #Y_0#'s bra from its provocative perch on a crucifix.

-- #X_0# --
One of the high school boys. Even at fourteen, #X_0#'s gut, tall tales, gold rings, sleek black shoes, and intimidating presence leave no doubt that he is the son of Sammy "The Shark" #X_0#, a suspected local gangster. While the boys rarely believe #X_0#'s elaborate tales, he commands their uniform fear and respect. It is #X_0# who, exploring storm sewers, comes up into the #Y_0# house and discovers #X_1# in the bathtub bleeding from her wrists.

-- #X_0# --
The practical joker. #X_0# makes farting noises at school assemblies, he nonetheless wins all the school prizes. #X_3# chooses him as part of the Homecoming coalition in hopes that his academic successes will impress Mr. #X_2#. #X_0#'s signature act, done on the way to Homecoming, is to stick his finger into #Y_0#'s smoke ring so as not to let it "die a virgin." On Homecoming, he is paired with #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
Son of a Christian Scientist. #X_0# worries about and prays for the #Y_0# girls' salvation, and is sometimes seen with his eyes closed and his lips moving as the girls walk by. He appears as a decent, hardworking boy, raised by his religious father to go the extra mile. He helps neighbors and sweeps bugs from the #Y_0# house to save the girls the trouble.

-- #X_0# --
#X_4#'s Homecoming date. A comparatively rich, usually proper boy, #X_0# is notable for his occasional access to his father's yellow Cadillac, in which he, #X_5#, #X_3# and #X_2# take the #Y_0# girls to Homecoming.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s Homecoming date. A source of continual speculation about the girlsand actively involved in finding out more about them, #X_0# is the epitome of a typical suburban boy—he plays football and helps #X_2# tune up his car.

-- #X_0# --
The neighborhood brain. #X_0# is overly smart and physically weak. When the boys need plots, insight, codes, anatomical remarks on fish flies, or handwriting analysis, they turn to #X_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A particularly shy boy. #X_0# Nonetheless, #X_0# finds the courage to enter the #X_1# house on the night of June 15th, as the other boys stand paralyzed by the vision of #X_2# in the living room.

-- #X_0# --
A neighborhood boy. #X_0#'s most remarkable characteristic is that his house is directly across from the #X_1#', and is thus a regular place of gathering for the other boys eager to see what the girls are doing.

-- #X_0# --
A polite Polish boy. #X_0# lives in a mansion a block away from the #X_2#'s house, from which bats fly out of the chimney each evening. He is the only one who remembers to shout thank you to the #X_2#s as the boys flee #X_1#'s party.

-- #X_0# --
The hospital psychiatrist. #X_0# is responsible for dealing with the #X_2# cases. After extensively testing #X_1#, he concludes that her first suicide attempt was a cry for help, and suggests she be given more social outlets. Upon her death and the family's subsequent disintegration, he begins to revise his hypothesis, diagnosing the surviving sisters with post-traumatic stress syndrome and warning of the high incidence of repetitive suicide in individual families. #X_0# is a respected local authority. The community, who seeks a scientific or medical rationalization for the tragedy, eagerly receive all of his diagnoses of the girls. Although his diagnoses and recommendations seem relevant and humane, if somewhat benign, they cannot stand up to Mrs. #X_2#'s opinion nor be implemented without her consent, and thus are of little actual use to the girls.

-- #X_0# --
Two men who drive the community's emergency vehicle. One is tall and thin with oily hair, the other is fat and lame with sensitive skin and razor bumps. #X_0#y inevitably drive over the #X_1#s' lawn, and seem to be moving much more slowly than they should. #X_0#ir characteristics become more familiar to the boys with each of the five arrivals of the #Y_0# truck at the #X_1# house.

-- #X_0# --
The Greek grandmother of Demo #X_0#, one of the neighborhood boys. She survived the Turkish massacre of her village as a young woman and hid in a cave for a month eating olive pits. She now spends her days in the semi-darkness of the #X_0# basement, remembering Asia Minor. She waits to die, uninterested in all self-important suburban dramas except for the plight of the #X_3# sisters, which saddens her but does not seem to surprise her. The boys suspect that she and the girls secretly communicate, sharing the same deep knowledge of the world's pain and reading the same signs of tragedy in the clouds.

-- #X_0# --
An overly suave Italian boy of romantic temperament. #X_0# lives with his relatives in the neighborhood. He hespeaks little English but is desperately in love with local rich girl #X_2#. To prove his love, and his despair at her leaving for vacation, he jumps from the roof of his relatives' house, emerging unharmed and satisfied. Shortly thereafter, his family calls him to #Y_0#. Neighborhood speculation suggests, probably wrongly, that his jump inspired #X_1#'s own.

-- #X_0# --
A social worker. #X_0# was hired by the high school after #X_2#'s death and she is thought to be the only person in whom the #Y_0# girls confided. However, there is no way of knowing for sure, as #X_0# disappeared after her credentials were discovered to be false, and the patient records she had kept were later destroyed in a freak fire.

-- #X_0# --
The local Catholic priest. #X_0# is a sympathetic, if minor, character who visits the #Y_0# house after #X_1#'s death, and pronounces the sisters "buffeted but not broken."

-- #X_0# --
The protagonist of the play. #X_0#'s name means "The Fox" in Italian. He is lustful, lecherous, and greedy for pleasure. He is also energetic and has an unusual gift for rhetoric, mixing the sacred and the profane to enunciate a passionate commitment to self-gratification. He worships his money, all of which he has acquired through cons, such as the one he now plays on #Y_2#, #Y_0#, and #Y_1#. #X_0# has no children, but he has something of a family: his parasite, #X_4#, his dwarf, #X_5#, his eunuch, #X_2#, and his hermaphrodite, #X_1#. #X_4# is his only true confidante, and he begins to lust feverishly after #X_3# upon first setting eyes on her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is #X_1#'s parasite, a combination of his slave, his servant, his lackey, and his surrogate child. Though initially (and for most of the play) he behaves in a servile manner towards #X_1#, #X_0# conceals a growing independence he gains as a result of the incredible resourcefulness he shows in aiding and abetting #X_1#'s confidence game. #X_0#'s growing confidence, and awareness that the others in the play are just as much "parasites" as he—in that they too would rather live off the wealth of others than do honest work—eventually bring him into conflict with #X_1#, a conflict that destroys them both.

-- #X_0# --
The voice of goodness and religiosity in the play, #X_0#is the wife of #X_2#, who is extremely beautiful, enough to drive both #X_3# and #X_2# to distraction. She is absolutely committed to her husband, even though he treats her horribly, and has a faith in God and sense of honor, traits which seem to be lacking in both #X_2# and #X_3#. These traits guide her toward self- restraint and self-denial. Her self-restraint makes her a foil for #X_3#, who suffers a complete absence of that quality.

-- #X_0# --
One of the three legacy hunters or carrion-birds—the legacy hunters continually circle around #X_1#, giving him gifts in the hope that he will choose them as his heir. #X_0#is a lawyer by profession, and, as a result, he is adept in the use of words and, by implication, adept in deceit, something he proves during the course of the play. He is also something of a social climber, conscious of his position in his society and resentful at being overtaken by others on the way up.

-- #X_0# --
An extremely vicious and dishonorable character, #X_0# is #X_1#'s jealous husband. He frequently threatens to do disgusting acts of physical violence to her and her family in order to gain control over her. Yet he is more concerned with financial gain than with her faithfulness, seeing her, in essence, as a piece of property. #X_0# is another one of the "carrion-birds" circling Volpone.

-- #X_0# --
The third "carrion-bird" circling #Y_0#, #X_0# is actually extremely old and ill himself and is much more likely to die before #Y_0# even has a chance to bequeath him his wealth. He has a hearing problem and betrays no sign of concern for #Y_0#, delighting openly in (fake) reports of #Y_0#'s worsening symptoms.

-- #X_0# --
The son of #X_3#. #X_0# is an upright youth who remains loyal to his father even when his father perjures against him in court. He heroically rescues #X_2# from #X_4# and represents bravery and honor, qualities which the other characters seem to lack.

-- #X_0# --
An English knight who resides in #Y_1#. #X_0# #X_0# represents the danger of moral corruption that English travelers face when they go abroad to the continent, especially to #Y_0#. He occupies the central role in the subplot, which centers on the relationship between himself and #X_1#, another English traveler much less gullible than the good knight. #X_0# #X_0# is also imaginative, coming up with ideas for moneymaking schemes such as using onions to detect the plague, as well as the idea of making a detailed note of every single action he performs in his diary, including his urinations.

-- #X_0# --
The #X_0#is portrayed as a would-be courtesan. She was the impetus for the #X_0#s move to #Y_0#, because of her desire to learn the ways of the sophisticated Venetians. She is very well read and very inclined to let anyone know this, or anything else about her. She is extremely vain.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a young English traveler who meets and befriends Sir #X_1# upon arriving in #Y_0#. #X_0# is amused by the gullible Would-be, but is also easily offended, as demonstrated by his adverse reaction to Lady #X_2#'s suggestive comments.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#, as his named in Italian indicates ("nano" means "dwarf"), is a dwarf. He is also #Y_0#'s fool, or jester, keeping #Y_0# amused with songs and jokes written by #X_1#.

-- #X_0# --
The only notable fact about #X_0#is that his name means eunuch ("#X_1#" means "eunuch" in Italian). There is not much else to say about #X_0#, as he has no speaking lines whatsoever.

-- #X_0# --
"#X_0#" means "hermaphrodite" in Italian, and as in the case of #Y_0# and #X_1#, the name rings true. #X_0#apparently possesses the soul of #X_2#, according to #Y_0#, which has been in gradual decline ever since it left the ancient mathematician's body.

-- #X_0# --
One of the two main characters of the play. #X_4# calls him #X_3#, and the boy addresses him as Mr. #X_2#. He seems to be the more responsible and mature of the two main characters.

-- #X_0# --
The second of the two main characters. #X_2# calls him #X_1#. He seems weak and helpless, always looking for #X_2#'s protection. He also has a poor memory, as #X_2# has to remind him in the second act of the events that happened the previous night.

-- #X_0# --
He passes by the spot where #X_2# and #X_1# are waiting and provides a diversion. In the second act, he is blind and does not remember meeting #X_2# and #X_1# the night before.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s slave, who carries #X_1#'s bags and stool. In Act I, he entertains by dancing and thinking. However, in Act II, he is dumb.

-- #X_0# --
He appears at the end of each act to inform #X_2# that #X_1# will not be coming that night. In the second act, he insists that he was not there the previous night.

-- #X_0# --
The man for whom #X_3# and #X_1# wait unendingly. #X_0# never appears in the play. His name and character are often thought to refer to #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
Amateur naturalist, essayist, lover of solitude, and poet. #X_0# was a student and protégé of the great American philosopher and essayist Ralph Waldo #X_1#, and his construction of a hut on #X_1#’s land at #Y_0# is a fitting symbol of the intellectual debt that #X_0# owed to #X_1#. Strongly influenced by Transcendentalism, #X_0# believed in the perfectibility of mankind through education, self-exploration, and spiritual awareness. This view dominates almost all of #X_0#’s writing, even the most mundane and trivial, so that even woodchucks and ants take on allegorical meaning. A former teacher, #X_0#’s didactic impulse transforms a work that begins as economic reflection and nature writing to something that ends far more like a sermon. Although he values poverty theoretically, he seems a bit of a snob when talking with actual poor people. His style underscores this point, since his writing is full of classical references and snippets of poetry that the educated would grasp but the underprivileged  would not.

-- #X_0# --
Essayist, poet, and the leading figure of Transcendentalism. #X_0# became a mentor to #X_2# after they met in 1837. #X_0# played a significant role in the creation of #X_3# by allowing #X_2# to live and build on his property near #X_3# Pond. There is an appropriate symbolism in this construction site, since philosophically #X_2# was building on the Transcendentalist foundation already prepared by #X_0#. The influence of #X_0#’s ideas, especially the doctrine of self-reliance that sees the human soul and mind as the origin of the reality it inhabits, pervades #X_2#’s work. However, whereas #X_2# retreated to his own private world, #X_0# assumed a prominent role in public life, making extended overseas lecture tours to promote the view expressed in his renowned Essays. The two often disagreed on the necessity of adhering to some public conventions, and the heated tensions between the two may perhaps be felt in the minimal attention #X_0# receives in #X_3#. #X_2# utterly fails to mention that #X_0# owns the land, despite his tedious detailing of less significant facts, and when #X_0# visits, in the guise of the unnamed “Old Immortal,” #X_2# treats him rather indifferently.

-- #X_0# --
A laborer in his late twenties who often works in the vicinity of #X_2#’s abode. #X_2# describes #X_0# as “a Canadian, a wood-chopper and post-maker,” asserting that it would be difficult to find a more simple or natural human being. Although he is not a reader, #X_0# is nevertheless conversant and intelligent, and thus he holds great appeal for #X_2# as a sort of untutored backwoods sage. #X_2# compares the woodcutter to Walden Pond itself, saying both possess hidden depths.

-- #X_0# --
A poor Irish-American laborer who lives with his wife and children on #Y_1# just outside of #Y_0#. #X_1# uses #X_0# as an example of an “honest, hard-working, but shiftless man,” someone who is forced to struggle at a great disadvantage in life because he lacks unusual natural abilities or social position. The conversation that #X_1# and #X_0# have when #X_1# runs to the #X_0# home for shelter in a rainstorm is an uncomfortable reminder that #X_1#’s ideas and convictions may set him apart from those same poor people that he elsewhere idealizes. Rather than converse casually with #X_0#, #X_1# gives him a heated lecture on the merits of cutting down on coffee and meat consumption. Overall, his treatment of #X_0# seems condescending. His parting regret that #X_0# suffers from an “inherited” Irish proclivity to laziness casts a strangely ungenerous, even slightly racist light over all of #X_1#’s ideas.

-- #X_0# --
A friend whom #X_3# refers to as “the philosopher.” #X_0# was a noted educator and social reformer, as well as the father of beloved children’s author Louisa May #X_0#. In 1834 he founded #Y_4# in #Y_0#, a noted progressive school that spawned many imitators. Affiliated with the #Y_3#, he was known for a set of aphorisms titled “Orphic Sayings” that appeared in The Dial. #X_0# also had a hand in the utopian communities of #Y_1# and Fruitlands, and went on to become the superintendent of the #Y_2# public schools.

-- #X_0# --
#X_3#’s closest friend, an amateur poet and an affiliate of the #Y_1#. #X_0# was named after his uncle, a noted Unitarian clergyman. His son, Edward #X_0#, went on to become a noted professor of history at #Y_0#.

-- #X_0# --
A prominent Whig senator from #Y_1#. #X_0# ran unsuccessfully for president on three occasions. He was a supporter of internal improvements as a part of his #Y_0#, and is well known as “the Great Compromiser” for his role in the Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850. #X_1# was a staunch critic of #X_0# and of the expansionism that #X_0# advocated.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s second wife. #X_0# was somewhat distressed by her husband’s frequent absences from home. During her husband’s tours of Europe, #X_1# stayed with her, and the two developed a close friendship.

-- #X_0# --
A Chinese sage of the sixth century B.C., known for his sayings and parables collected under the title Analects. His teachings gave rise to a sort of secular religion known as Confucianism, which served as a model for the Chinese government in subsequent centuries. #X_0# also had a significant effect on the Transcendentalist movement, and was one of #X_1#’s favorite authors.

-- #X_0# --
A #Y_0#-trained lawyer. #X_0# eventually abandoned his first vocation for a career in letters. His poetic satire The Bigelow Papers was well received, and he went on to become a professor of modern languages at #Y_0# and the first editor of #Y_1#.

-- #X_0# --
A Chinese sage of the fourth century B.C. and a disciple of #X_1#. #X_0# was best known for his anthology of sayings and stories collected under the title The Book of #X_0#, and did much to promote the reputation of #X_1#, although he himself was not widely venerated until more than a thousand years later. Like his master’s work, #X_0#’s combination of respect for social harmony and the inward reconciliation with the universe exerted a powerful influence on #X_2#.

-- #X_0# --
Elder brother to Henry David #X_0#. The two brothers oversaw and taught at #Y_0#, a progressive independent school, from 1838 to 1841. #X_0#’s failing health was a contributing factor in the demise of the school, and he died in 1842 from complications related to lockjaw.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a professor of psychology, the protagonist of the novel, and the man through whose eyes we see #Y_0#. He is intelligent and professorial, but weary of the academic life. Although initially skeptical of #Y_0#, he becomes increasingly enthusiastic about it over the course of his visit.

-- #X_0# --
A former classmate of #X_1#'s at graduate school, #X_0# is now the founding member of #Y_0#. He is enthusiastic, hyper-verbal, and frequently pedantic. Unlike the children of #Y_0#, he is driven by an urge to dominate and achieve.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is a philosopher and one of #X_1#'s colleagues at the university. He is intelligent and a good debater, but rather closed-minded. He badgers #X_2# throughout his visit to #Y_0#, trying to expose some practical or principled reason why the community should not work.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# is one of #X_2#'s former classmates. After returning from service in WWII, he decides to try to find a better life than standard American capitalism (two cars, garage, wife, kids, money) can offer him. He is #X_4#'s friend and #X_1#'s boyfriend.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# and #X_2# became friends as servicemen during the war. #X_0# is quiet, but like #X_2# he is looking for a better way to live his life. He is #X_1#'s boyfriend.

Mrs. #X_0# is a member of #Y_0#. An attractive thirty-five year-old, she is in charge of "Clothing for Women" and helps #X_1# give a tour of the community on the first day of the visit.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator of Walk Two Moons. #X_0#is a high-spirited country girl deeply troubled by the loss of her mother. She gains strength from spending time in natural settings and from her Native American heritage, and many of her memories and experiences center on trees, rivers, wild berries, and mountains. Although she is rebellious and often skeptical of adults, she is open-minded and deeply compassionate. #X_0#tells her story with verve and humor, peppering her sentences with colorful comparisons and exaggerations.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s best friend in #Y_0#, #Y_1#. #X_0#, who lives next door to #X_1#, is a high-strung girl obsessed with propriety and order. #X_0# lives within a sort of manufactured drama, in which she transforms every small insignificant event into a menacing portent. #X_0# uses her propensity for melodrama, #X_2# theorizes, as a way to avoid dealing with bigger, more intractable, more universal fears, such as the fear of suffering, death, and hatred. Despite her stiff exterior, #X_0# desperately needs the love and security her family provides for her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# father's parents. #X_1#ps and #X_1# drive #X_3# across the country to visit her mother's final resting place in #Y_1#, #Y_0#. #X_1#ps and #X_1#, wacky and unpredictable, have been arrested several times for their innocent foibles, such as "borrowing" a tire from a police car. #X_1#ps and #X_1# married and lived in an unwavering spirit of love and joyfulness, despite the fact that #X_0# father is their only son, of four, who lived to adulthood. Though her #X_0#' unpredictability worries her, #X_3# looks to them for support, love, and adventure.

-- #X_0# --
A loving, gentle, almost too-perfect man. #X_0#takes #X_1# to #Y_0#, #Y_1# shortly after his wife's death because he is overwhelmed by grief for her at the farm. #X_0# #X_0#, struggling with his own overwhelming sense of loss, tries to deal patiently and compassionately with #X_0# anger, confusion, and rebelliousness. When they move to #Y_0#, he allows #X_1# to spend her time as she likes, often away from him. Ironically, his sweetness and gentleness often saddened #X_0# mother, making her feel thoughtless and selfish in comparison.

-- #X_0# --
A spontaneous and joyful woman closely attuned to the everyday beauty of the outdoors, #X_0#grew increasingly conflicted by her roles as a housewife and #X_0#. Her unhappiness grew into full-fledged depression as a result of her miscarriage and hysterectomy, causing her to decided to try to reconnect with who she was before she married and became a #X_0# by traveling to visit a cousin in #Y_0#. #X_1# adores the memory of her beautiful, gentle #X_0# and throughout the novel struggles to come to terms with the events and forces that led up to her #X_0#'s departure.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s mother. Like #X_1# herself, #X_0#is obsessed with propriety. She works diligently as a housewife and mother, baking, sewing, cooking, cleaning, chatting pleasantly at the dinner table, but becomes increasingly saddened by her family's disregard of her. Convinced that her life has become insignificant and meaningless, she one day disappears in an attempt to reconcile herself to her past and her true self.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#'s father. Like his wife, #X_0#fills his role as husband and father exactingly.

Mrs. #X_0#'s sudden departure challenges his understanding and expectations of her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s next-door neighbor and #X_3#'s father's friend. #X_0# helped #X_3#'s father find a job selling farm machinery in order that he could live in #Y_0#, away from his farm. Although #X_3# feels deeply suspicious of #X_0#'s intentions toward her father, #X_0# realizes that #X_3#'s father sees her only as a friend and understands that their friendship is based on the fact that #X_0# befriended #X_3#'s mother during her last days alive. #X_0# herself suffered a great tragedy when she lost her husband in a car accident.

-- #X_0# --

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# “good friend,” who is implied to be her romantic partner.

-- #X_0# --
One of the narrators. #X_0# is friendly, garrulous, and in many ways the glue that holds the group of friends together. He is the least snobbish of the group, willing to talk to anyone as an equal. #X_0# wants to become a novelist, though his hopes go unfulfilled. By the end of the novel, however, he achieves the greatest insight into the lives of the other characters.

-- #X_0# --
The headmaster at the private boarding school the boys attend. #X_0# represents both traditional authority and religion, and the boys’ individual responses to him are telling. #X_3# despises him as a repressive, pompous, insincere figure, while #X_2# admires him as the representative of the English society he so much wants to be a part of. #X_1# sees the headmaster primarily as a character about whom he can spin a story.

-- #X_0# --
One of the narrators. #X_0# is a beautiful, upper-class woman who leads the life of a glamorous socialite. She is grounded in the here-and-now, rarely wondering about the deeper significance of events or the symbolic value of things—a marked contrast to her friends. She is intensely physical, seeing her body and her sexuality as her primary means of interacting with the world. #X_0# is perhaps the most static of the main characters, though she does come to terms with her own aging.

-- #X_0# --
One of the narrators. #X_0#’s father is an Australian banker, and #X_0# is painfully aware of his own accent and his lower-class status in comparison with his friends. He is driven by a desire to escape his position as an outsider and to prove the superiority of his own intellect. #X_0# becomes a successful businessman, but he also wants to become a poet in order to make something permanent out of the passing disorder of everyday life. #X_0# is attracted to both the concrete reality of life in #Y_0# and the ideal realm of art. He and #X_2# are lovers for a time, but she eventually leaves him.

-- #X_0# --
One of the narrators. #X_0# is refined, intellectual, and upper class, with a deep appreciation of beauty. #X_0# loves #X_1# from afar, admiring him for being everything #X_0# is not—athletic, charismatic, and grounded in practical reality. After #X_1#’s death, #X_0# pursues many different lovers, devoting himself intensely to each for a time and then moving on. #X_0# desires order and beauty, and he tries to exclude much of the disorder and ugliness of the world from his life by isolating himself with his books and his lovers. #X_0# becomes a famous poet.

-- #X_0# --
A friend of each of the main characters. The boys meet #X_0# at school, where he is one of the most popular students. #X_0# is handsome and charismatic, a natural leader. He is killed when he is thrown from a horse in #Y_0#, where he has gone to work in the colonial government. #X_0# is in love with #X_2#, though he does not act on it, and #X_1# is in love with him, though #X_0# has no idea. #X_0# is an idealized figure for the other characters, and they each respond deeply to his death, though in different ways.

-- #X_0# --
One of the narrators. #X_0# is introverted, highly sensitive, and almost phobic when it comes to interacting with others. She tends to drift off into her imagination as a means of escaping from social situations, and she comes to feel that her own personality is insubstantial and illusory. #X_0# and #X_1# become lovers, but #X_0# is terrified of intimacy and leaves him. Eventually #X_0#’s sense of the transience of life and her own desire for unconsciousness lead her to take her own life.

-- #X_0# --
One of the narrators. #X_0# hates city life and cannot wait to return home from school to her family farm, where she wants to tend the land and raise children. #X_0# is an earthy, passionate woman who is highly compelling to men, though not as classically beautiful as #X_2#. #X_0# has an intense relationship with the land and with nature, but her cultivation of this natural bond leads to the suppression of many of her other desires. #X_0# loves #X_1#, for example, but sacrifices any passion of her own for the sake of her family and her place in the cycle of rural life.

-- #X_0# --
A cardiologist. #X_0# talks more than anyone else in the story. He and #X_2# have been married for four years. #X_0# has two children with his ex-wife, #X_1#, whom he now hates. Although #X_0# makes grand proclamations about knowing what love is, he ultimately reveals that he is confused and even alarmed by the elusiveness of love and devotion.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator. #X_0# and #X_1# met at work, but #X_0# never says exactly what he does. He is thirty-eight and has been with #X_1# for about eighteen months. He doesn’t say much in the story, but the observations he makes about the changing light, amount of remaining gin, and sound of beating hearts gives the story its rhythm.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1#’s wife. #X_0#, thirty-five, is a legal secretary. She barely speaks at all in the story other than to say that she and #X_1# understand love and, at the end, that she’s hungry. But her gentle physical interactions with #X_1#—holding hands, touching knees—give a glimpse of what love means to her.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#’s wife. #X_0# used to live with an abusive boyfriend named #X_1# who tried to kill her. Even though #X_1# later threatened her and #X_2# before killing himself, #X_0# believes that #X_1# truly loved her. Everyone seems to disagree with how she defines love, but her ideas are clearer than anyone else’s.

-- #X_0# --
The narrator. #X_0# #X_0# is a #Y_1#ese peasant who grows up on the central coast of #Y_1#. She leaves #Y_1# in 1970 for #Y_2# with her American husband and two children.

-- #X_0# --
#X_1# eldest sister. #X_0#’s husband leaves to fight with #Y_1# early in their marriage and is never seen again. She lives in #Y_0# with her daughter #X_2# until her father’s death, when she returns to the family home to tend to the land and the family shrine.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2# and #X_4#’s second daughter. After #X_0#’s husband leaves for the North, his cousin #X_1#, a local Republican official, bullies her into marrying him. #X_0# hoards all of the gifts that #X_3# sends from #Y_0#, causing a rift with the rest of the family. She is accepted back only after #X_3# convinces her mother of the importance of forgiveness.

Though #X_0# is the narrator, she shares the protagonist role with her mother. Her memories of own life do not figure prominently until the final chapter, "A Song for a Barbarian Reed Pipe," in which she grows out of the frustrations of her childhood and finds her own voice.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s mother, whose "talk-stories" about Chinese life and traditions haunt #X_2# like ghosts from another world. #X_0#is a proud and intelligent woman who comes off as both gentle and cruel in equal parts in the memoir. She appears throughout the book but figures most prominently in "Shaman," which depicts her life in #Y_0# as a doctor and a woman of almost magical powers.

-- #X_0# --
Brave #X_0#'s sister, who comes to #Y_0# in her 1960s. #X_0# emigrates—at Brave #X_0#'s encouragement—in an attempt to find her estranged husband, who left #Y_1# thirty years earlier.

-- #X_0# --
#X_2#'s unnamed aunt, who kills herself and her illegitimate child in #Y_0# by jumping into the family well. #X_2# knows nothing about aunt and must make up stories in "#X_0# #X_0#." #X_2# portrays her aunt as a timid woman who gave into a forbidden passion and was then driven to suicide when she was cast out from the village.

-- #X_0# --
A heroic female warrior from a traditional Chinese legend, whom Brave Orchid originally described to #X_3# in a talk-story. #X_0# represents both the Chinese female ideal—as a loving mother and wife—and a source of great power and independence. #X_3# feels a kinship with the woman warrior and, in "White Tigers," re-imagines her story in the first person, as if she were the warrior herself. #X_3# also contrasts #X_0#'s great accomplishments and victories with the disappointments of her own life.

-- #X_0# --
A classmate whom #X_1# torments when she is young, as related in "A Song for a Barbarian Reed Pipe." Both #X_1# and the #X_0# are quiet and unpopular, so #X_1# hates the #X_0# for reminding her of her own weaknesses.

-- #X_0# --
A successful doctor in #Y_1#, he had not seen #X_0# Orchid in thirty years before the confrontation described in "At the Western Palace." He is typical of many emigrant Chinese who find new lives in #Y_0# and try to forget their old responsibilities.

-- #X_0# --
An elderly #X_0# who, in "White Tigers," train #X_1# in martial arts and survival skills on top of the mountain. #X_0#are quasi-deities—#X_1# sees that they are hundreds of years #X_0#—and, significantly, are more like parents to the woman warrior than her own parents are.

-- #X_0# --
A Chinese poetess born in 175 A.D., the source of the title of the final chapter. #X_0# was captured by barbarians and forced to fight their battles, and brought back to her people, the Han, a song called "Eighteen Stanzas for a Barbarian Reed Pipe." She serves a metaphor for both #X_1#'s own project in writing her memoir—bringing her songs to her people back from "savage lands"—and for the act of talk-story in general.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0# #X_0#, who runs the laundry in #Y_0# with #X_1#, appears in the book only rarely.

-- #X_0# --
The name of the housing development in which the novel is set. Although #X_0# is a physical structure, it is personified and endowed with a spirit that brings it to life. #X_0# is at once a warm, loving community and a desolate and blighted neighborhood on the verge of collapsing.

She is given to fits of temper, and she is torn between her wild passion for #X_3# and her social ambition. She brings misery to both of the men who love her.

-- #X_0# --
Well-bred but rather spoiled as a boy, #X_0# grows into a tender, constant, but cowardly man. He is almost the ideal gentleman: #X_1# accurately describes him as “handsome,” “pleasant to be with,” “cheerful,” and “rich.” However, this full assortment of gentlemanly characteristics, along with his civilized virtues, proves useless in #X_0#’s clashes with his foil, #X_2#, who gains power over his wife, sister, and daughter.

-- #X_0# --
#X_0#’s narration forms a frame around #X_1#’s; he serves as an intermediary between #X_1# and the reader. A somewhat vain and presumptuous gentleman, he deals very clumsily with the inhabitants of #Y_1#. #X_0# comes from a more domesticated region of #Y_0#, and he finds himself at a loss when he witnesses the strange household’s disregard for the social conventions that have always structured his world.

-- #X_0# --
For clarity’s sake, this SparkNote refers to the daughter of #X_4# Linton and the first #X_0# as “young #X_0#.” The first #X_0# begins her life as #X_0# Earnshaw and ends it as #X_0# Linton; her daughter begins as #X_0# Linton and, assuming that she marries #X_6# after the end of the story, goes on to become #X_0# Earnshaw. The mother and the daughter share not only a name, but also a tendency toward headstrong behavior, impetuousness, and occasional arrogance. However, #X_4#’s influence seems to have tempered young #X_0#’s character, and she is a gentler and more compassionate creature than her mother.

-- #X_0# --
The son of #X_4# and Frances #X_0#, #X_0# is #X_1#’s nephew. After #X_4#’s death, #X_3# assumes custody of #X_0#, and raises him as an uneducated field worker, just as #X_4# had done to #X_3# himself. Thus #X_3# uses #X_0# to seek revenge on #X_4#.
